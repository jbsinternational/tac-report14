    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Organization and Leadership</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The project's key players and organizations are seamlessly integrated and communicate well. For example, the project team works closely with staff from the community health centers (CHCs) to support SBIRT implementation. They have identified several champions within the clinics to manage SBIRT processes and have effectively integrated SBIRT into routine practice.</li>
<li>The project team is fully staffed. Its members work effectively together and exchange expertise.</li>
</ul>


</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">SBIRT Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The project has developed a clear, strong trajectory for implementation within clinic settings.</li>
<li>The project has carefully thought through patient screening and workflow in different clinic settings.</li>
<li>The project uses an innovative approach to coordinate the prescreen process. Use of low-tech strategies, such as color-coded sheets and stickers, has been an effective approach to document when patients require a prescreen and/or more attention from the behavioral health specialist (BHS).</li>
<li>SBIRT has been championed by clinical staff at each site, including the clinical nurse managers.</li>
<li>The project has integrated SBIRT into existing clinic operational practice, such as utilizing the basket system to relay screening results between medical assistant (MA) and BHS staff.</li>
<li>The project's key players and organizations are seamlessly integrated and communicate well. For example, the project team works closely with staff from the CHCs to support SBIRT implementation. They have identified several champions within the clinics to manage SBIRT processes and have effectively integrated SBIRT into routine practice.</li>
<li>The project team is fully staffed. Its members work effectively together and exchange expertise.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Positive prescreen rates are much higher than expected, largely driven by self-reported patient depression screening results. Program staffs are continuing to streamline protocol to ensure that depression is handled appropriately using brief intervention (BI), brief treatment (BT), or referral to treatment (RT). At this time, BHS prioritize around alcohol and drug use. Patients who receive positive depression prescreens are more likely to receive an orange sheet, as time and resources available to address patient depression is limited.</li>
<li>Drug use, particularly prescription varieties, is underreported. Program staff are working with clinic managers to identify strategies to address patient drug use more accurately.</li>
<li>An important aspect of SBIRT sustainability hinges around reimbursement. The team is actively pursuing opportunities to promote billing through use of activated codes. The grantee plans to experiment with test billing to inform code viability.</li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Practice Site Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The project's key players and organizations are seamlessly integrated and communicate well. For example, the project team works closely with staff from the CHCs to support SBIRT implementation. They have identified several champions within the clinics to manage SBIRT processes and have effectively integrated SBIRT into routine practice.</li>
<li>The project team is fully staffed. Its members work effectively together and exchange expertise.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Patient flow can be heavy, depending on the time of day. Fewer BHSs in the clinics could create backup and delay patient access to SBIRT services (as identified by orange sheets).</li>
<li>Although minimal, there is the potential for transposing errors when information from the universal prescreening form is transferred to SBIRT-specific forms.</li>
<li>As more moving parts go live, everyday tasks may become difficult to maintain. It will be important to ensure that processes are in place to handle the surge in activity.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Cultural Competence</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Indiana SBIRT project understands patient demographics at the various sites and has tailored clinic services accordingly. For example, WCHC is staffed with a Spanish-speaking BHS to serve its large Hispanic population. Other translation services are available to patients through a translation provider, as needed.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting sensitive patient demographic information and asking questions C through G as part of GPRA requirements can be difficult.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Training/Workforce Development</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A comprehensive training curriculum has been developed and is facilitated by an a motivational interviewing (MI) instructor to ensure fidelity to the model, program staff are working with and training clinic managers, MAs, and other support personnel to support best practices around administering prescreens accurately.</li>
</ul>


</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An important aspect of SBIRT sustainability hinges around reimbursement. The team is actively pursuing opportunities to promote billing through use of the activated codes. The grantee plans to experiment with test billing to inform code viability.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Policy Steering Committee</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The local Policy Steering Committee (PSC) is active and engaged, meeting every 2 weeks.</li>
<li>Local PSC activity has been highly successful, as demonstrated by its membership, which includes the chief medical officer for Wishard Clinics and clinic managers from the active sites.</li>
<li>The Indiana SBIRT project team has thought through the immediate and long-term needs of the program. The team is focusing not only on implementation considerations: it is also contemplating how to sustain activities beyond the grant's life.</li>
<li>The Indiana SBIRT project has adopted a proactive approach to sustainability that complements implementation efforts.</li>
<li>The PSC has engaged champions who will be able to help promote SBIRT in other practice settings.</li>
</ul>


</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The project has an active evaluation team whose members understand program implementation strategies and can interpret data effectively in real time to determine if programming adjustments are necessary.</li>
<li>The evaluation team has successfully remodeled the WITS database to accommodate SBIRT-specific data. The data have been integrated seamlessly with GPRA. The new and improved system allows for prescreening answers to be recorded and includes prompts to guide the BHS through the appropriate fields. This feature greatly reduces data entry errors and supports use of the correct treatment modalities.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Target numbers appear low, but that finding may be because SAMHSA counts treatment for alcohol and other drugs, not depression.</li>
<li>GPRA data collection and reporting requirements may require a dedicated staff member to support the effort. Providing regular feedback to the BHS and support staff will help emphasize the importance of obtaining reliable contact information from patients to GPRA followup.</li>
</ul>
</div>
