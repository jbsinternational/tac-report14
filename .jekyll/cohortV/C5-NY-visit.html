        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) SBIRT II program is a key part of New York&rsquo;s vision for an integrated primary care and behavioral health system. </li>
              <li>The grantee describes four interrelated goals: Deliver high-quality SBIRT services to 150,000 vulnerable New Yorkers, build a technology infrastructure, mobilize key stakeholder support, and disseminate sustainable SBIRT programs to other health care entities.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul><li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The initiative is organized and implemented through key partnerships and builds upon the State&rsquo;s prior successes with its first SBIRT cooperative agreement awarded in 2011. </li>
                <li>Leadership at North Shore-Long Island Jewish (NSLIJ) Health System demonstrates understanding of how systems work and change through shared decisionmaking with frontline staff supporting and informing program implementation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Project implementation is a collaborative effort among OASAS, NSLIJ Health System, CASAColumbia, and the Center for Practice Innovations at Columbia Psychiatry New York Psychiatric Institute.</li>
              <li>All programs of NSLIJ Health System have electronic health records (EHRs); the process of converting to a single EHR is underway.</li>
              <li>CASAColumbia provides comprehensive training, technical assistance, and evaluation services.</li>
              <li>The grantee has focused effort on champion recruitment and development supporting multiple levels of champions. </li>
              <li>SBIRT funds have contributed to collaboration of CASAColumbia and contractor RTI International to develop an interface to facilitate loading data without the need to reenter information in the Services Accountability Improvement System.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The grantee is currently exploring delivery of embedded brief treatment to begin in the second year of operation using health coaches and potentially staff social worker.</li>
                <li>Within NSLIJ Health Service, integration of four EHRs into a single system has consumed both technology and clinical resources to the extent that the needs of the SBIRT program have been lowered in priority, delaying SBIRT integration into this new system. </li>
                <li>Behavioral health providers appear to be at all levels of health information technology (HIT) readiness; it will be important for OASAS to support adoption of HIT by behavioral health providers across the State. </li>
                <li>The policy advisory committee plans to create a workgroup on HIT in year 3 of the grant.</li>
                <li>Challenges have included ensuring cultural sensitivity in the delivery of SBIRT, completion of full screens, turnover of nurses in emergency departments, in-person training for health coaches, and building brief treatment into the health coach model. </li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>New York SBIRT has three key partners that support implementation.</li>
              <li>The NSLIJ Health System has State-supported health homes with capacity for care coordination, including treatment planning.</li>
              <li>CASAColumbia coordinates implementation, training, reporting, and evaluation data collection with health care settings.</li>
              <li>The Center for Practice Innovations at Columbia Psychiatry New York Psychiatric Institute offers distance learning products to extend implementation of SBIRT statewide.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>One of the grant objectives is to support broad dissemination within the State. </li>
                <li>The grantee needs to strengthen its capacity for delivery of substance use disorder (SUD) treatment services. </li>

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Outside the NSLIJ Health System HIT system changes, there appear to have been limited efforts to increase capacity for the use of HIT by the SUD treatment providers. </li>
              <li>Much education and technical assistance will be needed to prepare the SUD provider system involved in this project, and statewide, for the impending changes associated with the Affordable Care Act implementation and Medicaid and managed care expansion. </li></ul></div>
