    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Organization and Leadership</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The State of Illinois was a Cohort I SBIRT grant recipient. The team is able to draw from lessons learned during the previous award period to inform current implementation strategies and other service delivery activities.</li>
<li>The program can also collaborate with the SBIRT Medical Residency cohort affiliated with ACCESS' network of FQHCs.</li>
<li>The Illinois SBIRT team consists of tenured Federal grants managers with extensive experience managing large and sometimes complicated grants.</li>
<li>A high-level champion is essential to program sustainability because of champions' unique expertise and ability to motivate change (i.e. policy, systems, etc.). The project is fortunate to have the backing of the Illinois Single State Authority for Substance Abuse Services' Associate Director and IDHS/DASA Director, Dr. Theodora Binion-Taylor. Dr. Binion-Taylor guided implementation of the first Illinois SBIRT grant and provides regular updates on SBIRT progress to the Illinois Office of the Governor and IDHS Secretary. The program is also championed by IDHS/DASA Medical Director, Dr. Seth Eisenberg, who actively trains staff at participating sites.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The project team described a need to further mobilize support from participating sites. The relationship between the State and ACCESS is still evolving and will require continued attention to effectively integrate SBIRT into these practice sites.</li>
<li>DASA requires each SBIRT practice site to develop a site-specific protocol for staffing patterns and patient flow, including staff ability to (1) complete the screening, (2) secure space to deliver brief intervention (BI), and (3) make and track referrals, as needed. Training on such policies has varied by site, as has staff and leadership willingness to champion SBIRT.</li>
</ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">SBIRT Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The project has formed a partnership with TASC, a nonprofit that offers SBIRT services to felony probationers and others involved in the Cook County criminal justice system. This unconventional opportunity extends SBIRT's reach to a unique and hard-to-reach population. The Juvenile Court Alternative Program (JCAP), for example, screens approximately 600-700 parents of youth who are engaged in the juvenile court system.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>SBIRT implementation within ACCESS sites has been challenging as a result of a reduction in the number of originally planned service sites (from six to two clinics), conflicting organizational priorities, and staff resistance to take on additional responsibilities. Moreover, changes in ACCESS' organizational leadership have caused a shift in support around SBIRT adoption.</li>
<li>SBIRT will be delivered by JCAP staff to clients who have been identified as high risk after completing the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) assessment tool; therefore, clients who fall into low- to moderate-risk categories are often overlooked.</li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Practice Site Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>SBIRT has been implemented in three high-volume clinics in and around the Chicago metropolitan area.</li>
<li>There is great potential to reach large numbers of at-risk patients at these sites.</li>
<li>Aunt Martha's Chicago Heights Clinic has designated office space for staff to coordinate SBIRT paperwork, make calls, and fax daily reports.</li>
<li>Aunt Martha's has a longstanding history of caring for patients with substance abuse issues. Its locations offer onsite services for patients in need of brief treatment (BT) and referral to treatment (RT). Although ACCESS has limited onsite support for patients in need of more extensive care, it is working to build onsite capacity, where possible, to address substance abuse.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Brief intervention (BI) is provided during the patient's first visit, but it appears that subsequent opportunities to receive BI are not readily available or pursued.</li>
<li>Currently, patients are screened only if a physician is available to offer BI assistance. Diversifying SBIRT skills among clinic staff will help to ensure that patients in need of a BI do not slip through the cracks.</li>
<li>There appeared to be a lot of negative or low-risk screening results. However, when speaking with providers at Aunt Martha's, it seemed likely that there was more substance use/abuse occurring among patients than is being identified through the screening process.</li>
<li>Each site has adapted SBIRT to match the clinic's unique workflow and culture. Coordinating workflow among clinicians, medical assistants, and case managers who participate in SBIRT delivery can be challenging until roles and responsibilities are better clarified.</li>
<li>Discretionary services are not currently provided. Medical assistants and providers do not have a lot of flexibility when delivering SBIRT screens. At times, there may be a conflict between the patient's screening score and the level of care that ought to be provided. Allowing the medical assistant or provider to deviate from the scoring criteria, when appropriate, may help capture a broader patient population in need of additional support.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Cultural Competence</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The practice sites employ a diverse workforce that reflects the populations they serve.</li>
<li>Bilingual support staff members are present onsite. Telephonic translation services are available, as needed.</li>
</ul>


</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Training/Workforce Development</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>HS/DASA Medical Director Dr. Seth Eisenberg is actively engaged in facilitating SBIRT training. Dr. Eisenberg's extensive experience in addiction psychiatry helps to elicit buy-in from other providers.</li>
<li>ACCESS, in conjunction with the Department of Labor, offers a career ladder program for its medical assistants, to support retention and professional development. They are empowered to address multiple health concerns, including smoking, substance use/abuse, and diabetes.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>It is unclear what quality improvement processes are in place to ensure that training is delivered with fidelity, and what followup support will be provided to ensure fidelity to the intervention model.</li>
<li>Based on a preliminary review of Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC)-developed SBIRT materials, an understanding of SBIRT as a public health approach to address substance use did not seem to be fully understood.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>SBIRT is implemented in high-volume FQHC (ACCESS) and FQHC "look-alike" (Aunt Martha's) facilities. Such venues complement the spirit of SBIRT by supporting the integration of primary care and behavioral health services for patients.</li>
<li>Aunt Martha's has committed to a "cross-integration" healthcare approach by aligning primary care, behavioral health, and social services among participating sites. Aunt Martha's also works closely with local hospital systems to manage patient overflow and to keep patients out of the emergency department. They have introduced care managers to help special needs patients access (and remain engaged in) service.</li>
<li>The project utilizes existing staff within practice sites to implement SBIRT. Physicians, medical assistants, and case managers have been trained to deliver SBIRT as part of their routine healthcare delivery model.</li>
<li>Promoting SBIRT as an integral part of medical culture and requiring active staff involvement will lend itself well to sustainability.</li>
<li>The grantee is actively working to integrate SBIRT into the electronic health record systems at its practice sites (NextGen Healthcare software [Aunt Martha's] and EPIC [ACCESS]). At Aunt Martha's facilities, the project would like to sync SBIRT with its pre-consultation screening and registration tablet system, Freesia.</li>
<li>Aunt Martha's has an active, progressive IT department; its team is able to develop electronic tools that can easily capture and transfer patient information to providers.</li>
<li>SBIRT is built into the Unified Data Systems (UDS) reporting requirement for FQHC reimbursement, which may help to leverage support for SBIRT within FQHCs. Currently, SBI must be reported annually in order to meet Medicaid funding criteria.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Significant cuts to the State's Medicaid budget and increased eligibility requirements impede reimbursement opportunities.</li>
<li>Reimbursement for SBIRT is challenging because providers may only bill for a single service during a visit, and there is little financial incentive to bill for SBIRT.</li>
<li>Expansion of the Medicaid codes will help support sustainability. Currently, SBIRT codes are only open to pregnant women; however, the program team would like to open the codes across the board to all SBIRT recipients.</li>
<li>Illinois Administrative Rule Code 2060 provides specific guidance (developed by the Joint Commission) on licensure requirements for providers delivering substance abuse treatment services. Several rules conflict with the principles of BT and require SBIRT providers to seek an exception. The grantee would like to incorporate BT into the administrative rules so that providers who wish to deliver BT will not be blocked by licensure prohibitions.</li>
<li>BT is a new service in Illinois and is completely funded by project grant dollars. Currently, there is not a mechanism for providers to bill the Department's Automated Billing and Tracking System (DARTS) for BT.</li>
<li>Establishing BT as a standalone service would expand billing opportunities.</li>
<li>There are compatibility challenges associated with using different electronic health record systems at ACCESS and Aunt Martha's.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Policy Steering Committee</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Policy Steering Committee (PSC)  consists of representatives from behavioral health organizations and senior leaders from State agencies, including the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, Illinois Department of Public Health, and the Illinois Department of Insurance.</li>
<li>PSC members appear to be frequently engaged in SBIRT discussions. The project hosts bimonthly conference calls in addition to email/phone exchanges, as needed. Members receive monthly service reports detailing project successes, challenges, and opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There are few primary healthcare representatives on the PSC.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee has a clearly defined plan for evaluation, including processes for GPRA collection, GPRA followup, and process evaluation.</li>
<li>The evaluation team employs a comprehensive (and well recognized) patient followup model, developed by Dr. Chris Scott of the Lighthouse Institute. The model utilizes comprehensive and creative strategies to track patients. Staff persistence and reliable locator information have consistently yielded followup rates in the 90th percentile.</li>
<li>The evaluation team has a quality assessment review process in place to ensure that baseline GPRA information is completed correctly before it is entered into the Services Accountability Improvement System (SAIS). Each site submits a daily patient/client enrollment report for review. Edit requests are created in cases where enrollment information is found to be incomplete or inaccurate.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The project has not met its monthly screening goal of 680 patients because of initial implementation challenges at proposed sites. Its recent partnership with Aunt Martha's may help boost screening numbers.</li>
<li>The evaluation team opted not to use an electronic data submission system because of complicated contract bidding processes within the State of Illinois purchasing system and concerns of it being too time consuming.</li>
</ul>
