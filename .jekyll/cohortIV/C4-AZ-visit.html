    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Organization and Leadership</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Strengths</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Senior leadership and program staff appear committed to adopting screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) within primary care and other systems throughout northern Arizona.</li>
            <li>The Policy Steering Committee (PSC) has representation from multiple sources: senior State agency leadership from GovernorÕs Office for Children, Youth and Families (GOCYF); Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS); Northern Arizona Regional Behavioral Health Authority (NARBHA); local providers implementing SBIRT; and a representative from the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System.</li>
            <li>In addition to convening quarterly PSC meetings, the grantee facilitates a monthly provider committee meeting to discuss successes and challenges related to implementing SBIRT.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantee staff involved in managing and implementing the SBIRT program are located at three different agencies: GOCYF, ADHS, and NARBHA. This situation presents challenges with oversight and management of grant activities, decisionmaking, communication, and coordination.
            </li>
            <li>The PSC has no representation from external agencies, professional organizations, or other State agencies.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">SBIRT Implementation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Strengths</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Program staff appear committed to working with implementation sites throughout northern Arizona to fully adopt SBIRT.
            </li>
            <li>SBIRT services are currently being implemented at four provider sites in northern Arizona. Providers at the sites, specifically Encompass Health Services and North Country HealthCare, strongly support the SBIRT model and are committed to successful implementation with their client populations.
            </li>
            <li>Grantee staff, specifically the NARBHA SBIRT coordinator, have established good working relationships with the various SBIRT providers. The coordinator provides ongoing guidance and support to the providers and assists them with overcoming implementation challenges.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The grantee currently uses a fee-for-service model of SBIRT implementation. This practice adversely affects grantee capacity to provide universal screening, serve the target number of patients, and meet followup requirements.
            </li>
            <li>No staff, either paid or unpaid, are dedicated to implementing SBIRT at provider sites. As a result, providers are overwhelmed with day-to-day responsibilities and competing priorities and do not have adequate incentives or resources to fully implement SBIRT.
            </li>
            <li>Although some screenings and brief interventions are being provided at the sites, clients are referred offsite for treatment. Many clients are, therefore, lost to the program before services can be provided and appropriate Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) data can be collected. Financial and personnel resources are limited at the provider sites; sites are unable to dedicate necessary time and staff to effectively implement SBIRT.
            </li>
            <li>Many sites have competing priorities that prevent them from fully implementing SBIRT with their client populations.
            </li>
            <li>Universal screening is not occurring at implementation sites.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Strengths</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Practice sites are committed to implementing SBIRT.
            </li>
            <li>GOCYF is actively involved with SBIRT implementation in northern Arizona.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medicaid codes are not currently activated in Arizona.
            </li>
            <li>Stakeholder involvement and buy-in of SBIRT appear to be limited.
            </li>
            <li>The grantee does not currently have a written plan that clearly delineates goals, objectives, strategies, leadership, and decisionmaking in support of SBIRT dissemination.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Training and Workforce Development
    </h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Strengths</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The SBIRT program coordinator provides motivational interviewing training to staff at all provider sites.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The grantee does not have a standard training curriculum or a regular training schedule. There is no system to train new staff hired after the initial training has been provided or to monitor fidelity of SBIRT implementation with existing staff.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Strengths</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>NARBHA has developed a data collection system that enables aggregation and production of reports on client demographics and services provided throughout the catchment area.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The grantee would like to improve the interface among the various electronic medical record systems (EMRs) being used by providers, their data collection system (FEi WITS), and the Services Accountability Improvement System (SAIS). An improved interface would eliminate duplicate entries and facilitate more efficient use of personnel resources.
            </li>
            <li>The target numbers in the grantee application were based on the population of the catchment area the grant serves rather than the population of clients who visit the clinics where SBIRT is being implemented. Followup is voluntary and is not being conducted.
            </li>


        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee-Led Enhancements</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <h4>Grantee-Led Enhancements</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Grantee Leadership</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delineate the management structure, decisionmaking, and lines of communication among the three primary agencies involved in implementation to improve capacity to meet grant requirements.</li>
            <li>Convene frequent face-to-face meetings with leadership staff from GOCYF, ADHS, and NARBHA to facilitate ongoing communication, planning, and decisionmaking.</li>
            <li>Recruit additional PSC members, including relevant community and State agencies, primary care organizations, nursing associations, and appropriate allied health professional groups.</li>
            <li>Convene a PSC workgroup to support activation of State Medicaid codes and to encourage implementation of SBIRT throughout northern Arizona.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Implementation</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Place dedicated, paid SBIRT staff at each site as an effective use of grant funds for successful implementation of SBIRT services.</li>
            <li>Develop a plan specific to each site to redesign implementation and workflow with a goal of universal prescreening, full implementation of SBIRT services, and appropriate GPRA data collection.</li>
            <li>Adopt process evaluation strategies to monitor and support practice site performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Sustainability Planning</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work with the regional partner to identify and engage organizations and local opinion leaders who may play a visible role in supporting and implementing SBIRT.</li>
            <li>Develop individualized strategies for key stakeholder engagement.</li>
            <li>Conduct regional trainings to raise awareness for providers and other key stakeholders on the effectiveness of the SBIRT model and the benefits of early intervention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Training and Workforce Development</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expand training capacity in support of SBIRT dissemination, including implementation of a train-the-trainer model.</li>


        </ul>

            <b>Grantee Evaluation</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consider discussing revised target numbers with SAMHSA as part of a revised implementation plan.</li>
            <li>Establish standard procedures for GPRA followup, including recruitment of clients, use of patient locator and consent forms, and effective followup strategies. Grant-salaried and grant-dedicated staff are appropriate to conduct GPRA followup.</li>
            <li>Deploy appropriate full-time staffing at practice sites to ease the data entry burden.</li>
            <li>Consider using grant resources to pay for the interface with the data collection system, the EMRs being used by the providers, and SAIS. Consider discussing this enhancement with the Government Project Officer before committing any resources given the planned release of a new system that will replace SAIS in approximately 18 months.</li>
