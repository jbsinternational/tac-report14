    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Organization and Leadership</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee team members are experienced grants administrators.</li>
<li>The grantee has a long history of partnering with New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.</li>
<li>The grantee is collaborating with hospitals in Watertown, New York, to serve the military community in Fort Drum/Watertown.</li>
<li>The grantee staff members are part of the State's Medicaid redesign team and advocate use of SBIRT throughout the Medicaid system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee implementation involves large, complex government and organizational systems, including city government systems in New York City, county systems, and hospital systems in Watertown.</li>
</ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">SBIRT Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New York State has successfully implemented the SBIRT program in three locations.</li>
<li>New York State is successfully collecting and uploading GPRA data.</li>
<li>The OASAS implementation model seeks to address organizational structure, context, and culture at each site.</li>
<li>The SBIRT program builds upon a foundation of prior successful SBIRT implementation in STD clinics in New York City.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee has chosen two very different geographic locations, cultures, and practice settings for SBIRT implementation. The implementation strategies are understandably different.</li>
<li>Communication with the Army commander at Fort Drum has been limited. There has been communication with Army medical and substance abuse services on the base.</li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Practice Site Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content">
<h3>New York City</h3>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SBIRT intervention is embedded into the routine at all three locations.</li>
<li>Universal screening is being conducted at the STD clinics.</li>
<li>GPRA data are being successfully collected and reported.</li>
<li>New York Medicaid has fully activated the SBIRT procedure codes.</li>
<li>The clinics have electronic medical records (EMRs) developed for their purposes.</li>
<li>Staff members are trained and are knowledgeable in the SBIRT process.</li>
<li>The program has a system in place to monitor and support fidelity of implementation and model adherence.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately twice the number of patients screen positive than were originally anticipated. This discrepancy has implications on finite staff resources and for the clinics' capacity to screen and deliver brief intervention to all patients in a single visit.</li>
<li>Given New York State laws that prohibit billing for STD-specific testing services, the STD clinics have not historically and do not currently bill for STD services. Staff members are not trained medical billers.</li>
<li>At this time, the SBIRT process is described as co-located within the medical practice. There is limited involvement with the clinic's primary care and allied staff.</li>
<li>The STD clinic EMR is a homegrown system and cannot interface with other primary care EMRs. The STD clinic sites are unfamiliar with insurance billing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Watertown/Fort Drum</h3>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SBIRT intervention has been successfully implemented in two hospital emergency rooms, an employee assistance program, and the Department of Social Services.</li>
<li>Staff members are trained and knowledgeable in the SBIRT process.</li>
<li>SBIRT staff members appear to be well received by the hospital staff.</li>
<li>GPRA data are being successfully collected and reported.</li>
<li>The program is prioritizing services to active duty service personnel.</li>
<li>The program has engaged Fort Drum's medical and behavioral health staff to support coordination of efforts and to find an acceptable balance between the Army's need to be informed regarding soldiers' involvement in treatment and readiness for duty versus the soldiers' need for privacy and to not experience negative career consequences as a result of seeking help for a substance use problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the two emergency departments is undergoing a large-scale performance improvement initiative that has consumed significant hospital staff resources; as a result, primary care staff has limited SBIRT involvement at this time. The second hospital has experienced a major reorganization of the upper management team, and is experiencing some financial problems that the county is aware of and all efforts are in place to keep the hospital operational.</li>
<li>Due to finite staffing and physician readiness, the programs are not now universally screening all patients. It is noted that there is only one full-time employee (FTE) sited at each emergency department and that the emergency departments operate 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. SBIRT staff members are being flexible with their schedules in order to be available during high-volume times at the emergency departments. Staffing at Carthage Hospital is being increased by a 0.5 FTE interventionist, and plans are underway to request an additional FTE interventionist at Samaritan Hospital. These changes will be carried out by realigning and reassigning current staff.</li>
<li>Staff members describe higher-than-expected negative screens, despite initial positive prescreens with service personnel. It appears that soldiers are concerned that they may experience negative career consequences if they self-identify as being at higher risk, and this concern influences their responses when being fully screened.</li>
<li>An ongoing challenge is finding an acceptable balance between the Army's need to be informed regarding soldier involvement in treatment and readiness for duty versus the soldiers' need for privacy and to not experience negative career consequences as a result of seeking help for a substance use problem.</li>
<li>The emergency department physicians and allied staff have limited involvement in the program at this time.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Cultural Competence</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee is serving highly diverse populations, including racial, ethnic, and linguistic adults.</li>
<li>The grantee is servicing a military population that has unique cultural attributes.</li>
<li>Screening documents are available in Spanish and English, and language translation is available for patients requiring screening and intervention in other languages.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The military has norms and culture that are important to understand in order to effectively engage and serve its personnel.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Training/Workforce Development</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee has a defined training curriculum to certify workers to deliver the SBIRT intervention.</li>
<li>The grantee has two training contractors to deliver the SBIRT training.</li>
<li>The grantee has trained all grant-funded staff in the SBIRT intervention.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limited training has been provided to physicians and allied health staff at this time. It is noted that physician trainings are being scheduled for the summer and fall of 2012.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) includes all levels of State government, including payers of services.</li>
<li>Senior leadership within State and New York City government are supporters and advocates for SBIRT.</li>
<li>The SBIRT billing codes have been activated within the New York Medicaid system, and a system for training and certifying workers has been developed and implemented.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A number of the implementation sites have limited insurance billing experience.</li>
<li>There appears to be limited physician involvement with SBIRT at this time.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Policy Steering Committee</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Membership in the New York PAC is wide-ranging and includes the Veterans Administration, Albany Medical Center, the Greater New York Hospital Association, the Association of Community Behavioral Healthcare, the Association of Substance Abuse Providers, New York City Department of Health, the New York State Academy of Family Physicians, the Medical Society of New York, and private and public insurers.</li>
<li>The PAC has convened and is developing workgroups that include a group addressing billing and finance in support of long-term sustainability and a group addressing marketing and information dissemination.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The association that represents federally qualified health centers is not currently part of the PAC. However, OASAS staff members are making outreach efforts to engage their participation.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee has a well-organized strategy for the collection and reporting of GPRA data.</li>
<li>The grantee is effectively using data to support successful implementation and to identify atypical activity, such as the high percentages of positive screens in New York City and the higher percentage of negative full screens among service personnel in Watertown.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee is currently using a labor-intensive, "paper and pencil" method and a desktop database to manage its GPRA data prior to uploading it into the SAIS system.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Clients Screened by End of First Year</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p>Screened: 15,477</p>
<p>Goal: 22,748</p>
