        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The InSight screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) medical residency program was built on the foundation established by the Texas State SBIRT program—Project InSight—which was a Cohort I SAMHSA SBIRT State grantee.</li>
              <li>Project InSight developed an SBIRT program model and integrated it into the Harris County Hospital District (HCHD) using evidence-based interventions. For 5 years, Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) partnered with Project InSight through a subcontract agreement to provide curriculum and materials development as well as medical director and psychology director services for the InSight program at Ben Taub General Hospital and seven community health centers in the HCHD. </li>
              <li>Consequently, the primary care faculty at BCM was familiar with SBIRT, helping secure buy-in during the early stages of program development. The BCM InSight SBIRT residency program staff have a continuing relationship with the Texas Project InSight program and participate in weekly calls with HCHD staff to discuss program updates and special issues such as the status of electronic medical record (EMR) changes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Curriculum Development</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The BCM InSight SBIRT curriculum was adapted and expanded from the Texas Project InSight&rsquo;s SBIRT training protocol, which employs evidence-based screening tools and interventions.</li>
              <li>A two-tier curriculum provides core SBIRT training for first-year residents in family medicine, general internal medicine, psychiatry, emergency medicine, and medicine-pediatrics and indepth training for faculty champions and resident champions.</li>
              <li>A three-question initial screening tool is used to detect alcohol and drug use.</li>
              <li>The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST), or CRAFFT are used to further screen patients who have positive results on any initial screening questions. Patients&rsquo; levels of substance use are determined by evidence-based cutoff scores on these instruments, allowing interventions and referrals to treatment to be tailored to individual needs.  </li>
              <li>An array of curriculum tools supports the InSight medical residency curriculum.</li>
              <li>Booster training sessions are provided to residents and champions.</li>
              <li>The tobacco screening question was added at the request of the HCHD because of an institutional requirement for tobacco use screening and referral to the HCHD Smoking Cessation program.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Residents receive basic (core) in-person SBIRT training consisting of four 1-hour modules that can be presented in one or more sessions, as well as regular experiential learning sessions with preceptors in the clinic.</li>
              <li>Residents are familiarized with the &ldquo;MI spirit&rdquo; to gain a working knowledge of brief intervention services embedded in HCHD and are trained to perform a brief intervention when needed.</li>
              <li>The training for faculty and resident champions is provided over 3 full days; attendance at all 24 hours of training is mandatory for all champions.</li>
              <li>Booster training sessions are provided to residents and champions four to six times per year.</li>
              <li>The screening instruments are fully incorporated into the EMR systems at the Baylor Clinic, MEDVAMC (the VA Medical Center), and the HCHD.</li>
              <li>The grant fully supports salaries of faculty champions.</li>
              <li>The program provides SBIRT training to behavioral health professionals, nurses, and physician assistants.</li>
              <li>In clinical practice, the residents&rsquo; practice of brief intervention varies by setting. Residents who practice in the community health center continuity clinic are encouraged to perform brief interventions, whereas residents who practice at Ben Taub General Hospital can either perform brief interventions or refer patients to the onsite SBIRT specialists. Residents at MEDVAMC perform brief interventions with all patients who screen positive.</li>
              <li>BCM&rsquo;s SBIRT train-the-trainer model involves the gradual and, ultimately, complete transition of SBIRT training, curriculum development, and training implementation to faculty and resident champions. By the end of the grant period, the responsibility for SBIRT training will rest fully with the individual residency programs, which will be prepared to provide comprehensive training.</li>
              <li>The InSight SBIRT medical residency program recruits two or more faculty champions from each participating residency program. Faculty champions are responsible for implementing SBIRT into their clinical practice, observing the skill performance of residents directly and providing feedback, and assuming gradual, but complete, training responsibilities for SBIRT in their residency programs. Some champions are residency directors, which elevates the importance of SBIRT in these specialties. An associate dean who also champions SBIRT provides administrative support for SBIRT and teaches some champion training sessions.</li>
              <li>Two residents from each participating specialty area are selected yearly to receive indepth champion training along with faculty champions. Priority is given to students who are planning careers in academic medicine so that they can disseminate the training later in their careers. These resident champions have the responsibility of precepting junior residents in SBIRT.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Scheduling</strong>—Training must be scheduled months in advance, and each residency&rsquo;s process for scheduling training is different. At least two hurdles must be crossed: identifying the person in each residency who is responsible for scheduling; and identifying a time that will accommodate most trainees. </li>
              <li><strong>Training targets</strong>—The BCM Insight SBIRT staff have invited other residency programs and other University of Texas medical schools to participate in an effort to meet training targets.</li>
              <li><strong>Adherence to protocols</strong>—Residents require continuous reminders and booster sessions to increase adherence to SBIRT in clinical practice. Otherwise, the number of referrals tends to drop off.</li>
              <li><strong>Preceptors</strong>—Residency programs that have many residents and only a few champions have had difficulty precepting all residents. For example, internal medicine has 2 faculty champions and 44 residents—a challenge for the preceptors. The BCM InSight staff provided booster training during grand rounds to increase training support for the residents. </li>
              <li><strong>Feedback to champions</strong>—As part of level two training, champions were given digital recorders to tape their SBIRT patient encounters. The de-identified recordings were uploaded to a secure Web site, where a subcontracted motivational interviewing coach listened to the recordings and provided feedback to each champion by phone or email. The greatest barrier to this coaching method has been the amount of time required to obtain patient consent. Faculty champions have indicated that this represents an insurmountable hurdle in providing ongoing coaching.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Technology Solutions</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The SBIRT screening tools have been incorporated into EMRs at all BCM clinics, MEDVAMC, and HCHD. </li>
              <li>The BCM InSight SBIRT program staff work with HCHD administrators to integrate the evidence-based prescreening tools into their EMR system, so the tools, originally incorporated during the State grant program, have been updated to reflect new evidence. </li>
              <li>Through efforts of the SBIRT medical residency training team, in conjunction with a motivational interviewing faculty champion, the DAST tool was successfully added to the MEDVAMC EMR system.</li>
              <li>The InSight SBIRT medical residency program has developed a Web site that contains comprehensive training information, including SBIRT training materials and slides (for in-person and online delivery), practice cases, alcohol and drug fact sheets, screening tools, resources, research, Internet links, and additional resources. A link to the Web site is presented on BCM&rsquo;s Graduate Medical Education Web page (<a href="http://www.bcm.edu/education/sbirt/index.cfm?PMID=0)." target="_blank">http://www.bcm.edu/education/sbirt/index.cfm?PMID=0).</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The effort to integrate evidence-based screening questions into the EpicEMR system at Ben Taub General Hospital and other HCHD settings has been a formidable challenge.</li>
                <li>The IT administrators who oversee EpicEMR have indicated that the current screening questions in Epic cannot be modified until other system priorities are addressed. </li>
                <li>BCM InSight staff are negotiating with administrators about the use of evidence-based screening tools</li></ul></div>

                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>BCM&rsquo;s physician implementation model&rsquo;s phased train-the-trainer approach prepares faculty and resident champions to assume complete responsibility for sustaining the InSight SBIRT program.</li>
                <li>The program staff, associate dean, and champions are enthusiastic about SBIRT and invested in ensuring its sustainability at BCM.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>The BCM SBIRT evaluation assesses the training satisfaction of residents and champions.</li>
                <li>At followup, 83 percent of trainees indicated that they had applied what they had learned in their work.</li>
                <li>Although residents&rsquo; satisfaction with SBIRT appeared to decrease after 30 days, the majority of residents continued to agree that they were satisfied with the training.</li>
            </ul>
