                        <p>In its first 2 grant years, the Mercer Medical Residency Training Program developed a comprehensive, interactive 12-module training for primary care residents; completed SBIRT training by two cohorts of primary care residents; integrated SBIRT within clinic settings, including standardized protocols involving residents and allied staff; integrated SBIRT into the electronic medical record system; developed and used standardized patients; and developed a training and protocol to address pain management and prescription opioid misuse, abuse, and dependence. The protocol is an adaptation of SBIRT to address the patient population’s unique needs. Staff reported plans to submit a proposal to the National Institute on Drug Abuse to further study the protocol’s efficacy in a primary care setting.</p>

Pediatrics planned to launch a project for residents, involving iPads preloaded with SBIRT references, including the resource directory.</p>
