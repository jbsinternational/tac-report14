        <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee   Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Leadership Council is made up a diverse group of medical and nonmedical professionals whose training spans a range of disciplines from internal medicine, family and community medicine, psychiatry, social work, nursing, and evaluation. The team is highly collaborative and invested in screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) as a tool for addressing substance use and co-occurring conditions, particularly among San Francisco General Hospital&rsquo;s (SFGH) underserved, vulnerable patient population.</li>
              <li>The Leadership Council has formed smaller workgroups to tackle responsibilities and next steps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The SFGH curriculum consists of lecture and experiential learning techniques that help residents develop skills and confidence to address various substance use disorders.</li>
              <li>A unique aspect of the SFGH curriculum is that it requires its Health Equity: Academics and Advocacy Training (HEAAT) residents to visit the Behavioral Health Access Clinic (BHAC) during their rotation to familiarize themselves with referral services available to patients and to observe (and later describe) the BHAC providers&rsquo; skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
        <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mandatory visits to BHAC serve as an opportunity for residents to learn, first-hand, about the full range of community referral services available to their patients. Such visits greatly enhance resident confidence in making referrals. The clinic is a driving vehicle for integrating systems of care for vulnerable, indigent populations, particularly those in need of medication-assisted therapy (e.g., buprenorphine). It has garnered the support of champions within hospital and city systems to bridge gaps in the provision of community-based health care.</li>
              <li>Efforts to train faculty include half-day clinic preceptor trainings, motivational interviewing workshops, and faculty and chief resident mentorship opportunities at the Chief Resident Immersion Training program.</li>
              <li>BHAC provides San Francisco residents with assessments and referrals to the city&rsquo;s various mental health and substance use services, including outpatient detoxification and residential treatment programs. </li>
              <li>The center is the result of the co-location and integration of six longstanding community behavioral health services: the Treatment Access Program, the Buprenorphine Induction Clinic, Mental Health Access, Offender Treatment Program, Centralized Opiate Program Evaluation Service, and a pharmacy. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fidelity to screening protocols is a challenge for residents who feel pressured by time constraints, language barriers, and discomfort addressing alcohol and substance use issues with their patients.</li>
              <li>SFGH has made significant inroads to promote SBIRT and identify champions within the hospital network. To date, however, the Department of Psychiatry continues to resist incorporating SBIRT into its curriculum. SFGH leadership hopes to forge a relationship with those in psychiatry over time.</li>
              <li>SFGH is responsible for coordinating SBIRT training for more than 90 faculty members, residents, and nurse practitioners and more than 25 preceptors. The program recognizes the need for interprofessional teamwork training and implementation; however, such efforts are often impeded by lack of time and competing clinical and educational responsibilities. </li>
              <li>SFGH has worked with residency program directors and other key faculty members to adapt the SBIRT curriculum effectively. However, at the clinic level, it has been challenging to get a routine SBIRT procedure implemented at either the General Medical Clinic (GMC) or the Family Health Center (FHC). </li>
              <li>Although faculty members in both the Department of Medicine (DOM) and the Family and Community Medicine (FCM) program recognize the importance and rationale for integrating SBIRT into clinical practice, the medical directors of GMC and FHC operate in a fiscally constrained environment that cannot easily take on new initiatives.</li>
              <li>Implementation efforts in other departments are largely impeded by time constraints and competing responsibilities.</li>
              <li>Engaging in conversations on substance use with non-English-speaking patients can be challenging for residents. Although residents frequently use interpreters when speaking with patients, residents tend to feel that they are not part of the conversation or that certain nuanced meanings are not conveyed accurately. </li>
              <li>To improve cultural awareness and broaden understanding of the medical and psychosocial needs among its diverse patient population, SFGH developed a panel discussion that focused on targeted populations (e.g., women, Latino families, Asian Americans, and those participating in a mobile methadone van program). The discussion was highly relevant and engaging for FCM and internal medicine residents, and program staff members will continue such panel presentations in the future.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">DISSEMINATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>SFGH has delivered numerous trainings over the course of its grant. </li>
              <li>The program has successfully achieved its dissemination goals (i.e., identifying early adopters of innovation) by providing training across hospital departments, for various provider types, and in local and Statewide communities. </li>
              <li>SFGH has been effective at expanding training opportunities for nonmedical support staff, such as social workers. The grantee is motivated to continue expansion efforts and has developed rigorous training objectives for the remainder of the grant cycle.</li>
              <li>The SFGH SBIRT curriculum has been disseminated outside internal medicine and is well integrated into FCM. Several trainings with FCM residents and faculty have been conducted, and more are scheduled throughout the academic year. </li>
              <li>Interest from key stakeholders within other departmental residency programs (e.g., pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology and surgery) has developed and may pave the way for abbreviated SBIRT training to be included on their schedules.</li>
              <li>Discussions on SBIRT and addiction medicine have carried over to include University of California-San Francisco (UCSF) medical students during their third-year medicine core clerkship (i.e., the PRIME-US Medical Students Training—a seminar co-taught by second-year residents), nurses and nursing students, medical assistants, and physical therapists. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
        <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>SFGH is implementing a new electronic health record (EHR) system because the current version does not support SBIRT. eClinical Works will replace the current electronic Lifetime Clinical Record system over the next 1 or 2 years at SFGH. </li>
              <li>The new EHR system will enhance the integration of SBIRT throughout this network.</li>
              <li>Two SBIRT faculty members serve on the hospital&rsquo;s EHR committee.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Note noted<strong></strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>The California State budget for fiscal year 2012 called for a $500 million cut in university support, posing a threat to the university&rsquo;s academic and research mission and its ability to provide patient services.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The SFGH SBIRT program continuously assesses its performance through process and outcome measures that gauge the knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of residents and faculty toward SBIRT specifically and substance use disorders more generally. </li>
              <li>Patients provide an indirect assessment of provider practices via an annual anonymous waiting room survey at GMC. </li>
              <li>The program is developing a qualitative instrument to assess learner feedback on SBIRT curriculum and implementation practices in clinical settings.</li>
              <li>The SFGH evaluation component is robust. Evaluation results guide program improvements and adjustments as needed.</li>
              <li>A unique feature of the evaluation is the qualitative evaluation component, which allows for narrative reflection and lends a voice to quantitative findings.</li>
              <li>SFGH has developed a proficiency checklist to gauge resident skill based on direct observation in practice settings.</li>
              <li>Faculty trainers have successfully demonstrated the generalizability of patient-centered communication skills to facilitate behavior change with their patients regarding substance use and a broader spectrum of clinical issues (e.g., medicine adherence, lifestyle changes with regard to diabetes, and hypertension).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The internal medicine residents&rsquo; alternating &ldquo;2 months on, 2 months off&rdquo; ambulatory block schedule has a potential negative impact on 30-day Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) followup rates, as it becomes increasingly difficult to track residents during the second half of their rotation when they are back in the hospital wards. Web-based surveying has improved both GPRA and resident survey response rates. Similar issues arose when tracking faculty responses. Data collection procedures will be modified accordingly.</li>
              <li>At baseline, many residents are reluctant to participate in training on substance use and may lack the confidence to address and treat related disorders. Evaluators found that residents who ranked discomfort and lack of experience as barriers when screening and/or treating patients for substance abuse were less confident in their ability to engage in SBIRT. </li>
            </ul>
