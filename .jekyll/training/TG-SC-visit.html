        <h3 class="accordion-header">PROGRAM VISION AND DESIGN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The core content and customizable third module of the SBIRT training is an effective approach and enables each partner department to integrate training in a way that works best for a specific program.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Plans are not well established for training faculty, field supervisors, and other community partners who will be involved in administering and modeling the SBIRT training with students, residents, and professionals in the community.</li>
              <li>The SBIRT training vision and design emphasizes substance use disorders and not at-risk misuse. The SBIRT intervention is intended to target risky users and is most effective with that population. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header"> GRANTEE LEADERSHIP</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The core grantee staff and university faculty and leadership are committed to incorporating SBIRT in their academic programs, and they seem to understand and appreciate the critical importance of the experiential component of the training. </li>
              <li>The grantee&rsquo;s council of directors is composed of representatives from each participating academic discipline and key community partners and stakeholders invested in the project&rsquo;s success.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The project has made significant progress on its implementation plan in a short time, including forming its council of directors and developing a three-module SBIRT training curriculum to be disseminated across disciplines. The curriculum is currently being rolled out to the nursing and rehabilitation counseling students.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plans for implementing the experiential component in some disciplines have not been fully developed. Some disciplines are planning to implement this component online—therefore, students might not fully appreciate the experience of implementing SBIRT with patients in practice settings.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">COMMUNITY LINKAGES, PARTNERS, AND PARTICIPATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p> <b>Strengths</b> </p>
            <ul>
          <li>The grantee has established strong partnerships with State government entities and community organizations that train health care professionals throughout the State. </li></ul>
          
           <p><b>Challenges</b> </p>
           <ul>
             <li>None noted.</li>
           </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="accordion-header">LEARNER RECRUITMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p> <b>Strengths</b> </p>
            <ul>
          <li>	The grantee made a concerted effort to garner commitment from various disciplines within the School of Medicine and other allied health professional programs. The decision to involve leadership from each discipline in determining where SBIRT best fits into the respective curricula will help ensure ongoing commitment and sustainability of the program after grant funding ends.</li></ul>
          
           <p><b>Challenges</b> </p>
           <ul>
             <li>None noted.</li>
           </ul>
        </div>
        
 <h3 class="accordion-header">AFFORDABLE CARE ACT READINESS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p> <b>Strengths</b> </p>
            <ul>
          <li>The existing partnership with Palmetto Health, along with the rollout of the SBIRT implementation plan, will generate SBIRT-ready medical professionals and facilitate health insurance and Medicaid reimbursements for substance use disorders and related treatment services.</li></ul>
          
           <p><b>Challenges</b> </p>
           <ul>
             <li>None noted.</li>
           </ul>
        </div>
<h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p> <b>Strengths</b> </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The staff made a concerted effort to garner commitment from various disciplines within the School of Medicine and other allied health professional programs. They also achieved buy-in from USC&rsquo;s Medical Education and Research Department, the deans of the residency programs, and other high-level university administrators. Staff have also established strong partnerships with State government entities and community organizations that train health care professionals throughout the State. Maintaining support from these partners will help ensure ongoing commitment and sustainability of the program after grant funding ends.</li>
          <li>The grantee and the disciplines involved in the SBIRT program have embedded SBIRT in the curriculum of existing courses. The infusion of SBIRT into existing courses will facilitate standardizing SBIRT content within required courses of USC students across disciplines.</li></ul>
          
           <p><b>Challenges</b> </p>
           <ul>
             <li>None noted.</li>
           </ul>
        </div>
        
 <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p> <b>Strengths</b> </p>
            <ul>
          <li>The grantee has developed carefully considered processes, procedures, and tools for capturing data and feedback regarding the quality and efficacy of the SBIRT training. </li></ul>
          
           <p><b>Challenges</b> </p>
         <ul>
           <li>Although the program implements a pre- and posttest of knowledge and attitudes, a more progressive learning approach to measure knowledge acquisition of key facts throughout the training could be beneficial for retention of information and engagement in trainings. </li>
             <li>There are currently no well-established plans for tracking use of SBIRT by training participants after graduation. </li>
         </ul>
        </div>

 <h3 class="accordion-header">RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Grantee-Led Enhancements </b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Program Vision and Design
            <ul>
              <li>Consider reviewing the training curriculum to ensure it reflects the effectiveness of SBIRT with at-risk users and those with substance use disorders.  <b></b></li>
              <li>In any communication about and promotion of SBIRT, include an emphasis on screening at-risk users as well as those with substance use disorders because risky misuse is much more prevalent than substance use disorders.<b></b></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Implementation Plan<b></b>
            <ul>
              <li>Consider migrating from the Blackboard e-learning system to a Web-based platform that will facilitate accessibility to learners outside USC.  <b></b></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Grantee Evaluation</b></p>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Consider adding embedded quizzes to measure and reinforce understanding of concepts throughout the training modules. </li>
            <li>Consider reducing the length of the Attitudes, Self-Perception of Skills and Knowledge Survey to increase the rate and accuracy of responses.</li>
            <li>Consider conducting focus groups with SBIRT faculty preceptors to garner enriched feedback regarding their experience with developing and implementing SBIRT curricula and trainee proficiency with assessments.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Program Vision and Design</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Consider developing a more substantial training plan for faculty and community partners. Ensuring that educators, preceptors, and field supervisors who mentor and train students and residents are fully trained and committed to implementation of the SBIRT approach will help translate training into practice.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Learner Recruitment</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Consider having coaching throughout the process of implementing a complete learning environment from classroom to clinic within the medical residency training programs. Integrating SBIRT into practice settings will provide learners with real-world role models, mentors, and clinical operations that support routine screening. This approach will also promote the sustainability of SBIRT in those settings after the grant has ended.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Affordable Care Act Readiness</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Consider receiving technical assistance pertaining to Affordable Care Act billing and coding and readiness for health information technology for SBIRT. Integration of screening and assessment in electronic health record systems and provider-friendly tools to document interventions for positive screens would help prepare for full implementation of the Affordable Care Act.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Grantee Evaluation</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Consider requesting peer-to-peer assistance to develop a plan for tracking the use of SBIRT after graduation.</li>
