<p>This SBIRT program is training bachelor of arts and master of social work students and pediatric medical residents to perform SBIRT in health care and social service settings in impoverished, underserved communities in Bronx, New York, and surrounding urban areas. The program has made progress in implementing SBIRT training in the Department of Social Work: Faculty are actively involved, a core curriculum and faculty guide have been developed, faculty buy-in is strong, and nearly half of the social work field instructors have been trained. Training for medical residents is in the initial implementation stages: Preceptors have been trained, and residents have received some training. The council of directors is active and has met to discuss social work trainees’ practice of SBIRT in field placements, tracking and evaluating trainees’ use of SBIRT, and program sustainability. To encourage students and residents to use SBIRT after they complete training, the program’s community agency team will work toward cultivating relationships with field practice sites and preceptors.</p>

<p>The Training in Adolescent SBIRT for Medical Professionals program plans to train students and fellows—including nurses, social workers, and subspecialty physicians who care for adolescent patients—to extend their medical professional knowledge and workforce capacity for undertaking SBIRT effectively. The program also seeks to disseminate SBIRT throughout the Boston community and to establish partnerships with health care entities throughout the State. The program has made progress in implementing training at the various institutions and is offering SBRIT training to preceptors. Experienced core program staff have worked toward gaining commitments from various internal departments and external educational institutions throughout Boston. Leadership from the various entities determine where SBIRT best fits into their respective curricula and training programs. The leaders—represented on the council of directors—help ensure continued commitment after grant funding ends. </p>

The program also plans to integrate the SBIRT curriculum in select courses across Indiana, create tailored Web-based educational modules, conduct face-to-face motivational interviewing training, and partner with behavioral health and primary care entities to diffuse SBIRT throughout the community. So far, the online curriculum modules and training materials are nearly complete. Implementation is planned to begin in the School of Social Work in June 2014 and in the School of Nursing and the College of Medicine in fall 2014. More than 50 sites are planned for student and medical resident internships and field placements. </p>

 <p>The Southeast Consortium for Substance Abuse Training: Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) SBIRT program plans to train about 1,500 master’s-level APRN students plus faculty and preceptors at 8 universities in Alabama, Georgia, and Maryland. Each site has a coordinator responsible for integrating SBIRT into the school’s curriculum, coordinating faculty and preceptors, developing a plan to measure student performance, and serving on the council of directors. The program model offers a mix of standardized nurse-specific SBIRT content and a central management unit administering to several satellite institutions. To date, the program has trained all site coordinators, developed all 19 training modules, and is using excellent evaluation tools. At least two faculty per site are to be trained. </p>

To date, the program has pilot-tested the curriculum in four nursing courses, two psychology courses, and two social work courses; trained family medicine residents during their psychiatric rotations through didactics and skills-based learning using the university’s simulation center; and obtained interdisciplinary commitment from the various faculty members on the council of directors. </p>

<p>The university’s School of Nursing and Health Sciences trains nurses, nursing students, medical residents, social workers, and counselors. The program team includes two schools within the University of Miami (Education and Nursing); the School of Social Work from Florida International University; and diverse practice settings that reach poor, underserved, largely minority populations. The program plans to train approximately 450 students per year in the classroom and several teams of supervisory professionals and students in practice settings. It will provide at least one regional training event per year. The program has an active council of directors and a network of community relationships with a history of delivering culturally appropriate substance use interventions to Hispanic patients. So far, core program staff have been trained, and team members are providing training to students, faculty, clinical staff, and staff of partnering organizations. </p>

<p>The Pennsylvania SBIRT Interdisciplinary Training Program anticipates training more than 2,857 medical residents and medical, pharmacy, dental, nursing, and social work students over 3 years. The program plans to disseminate SBIRT throughout the health care community by establishing partnerships and training SBIRT champions within the local health network. The program has created a Web site as a host portal for the SBIRT curriculum, for faculty and student resources, and for reported data. Materials have been reviewed and adapted using core competencies for each discipline to ensure appropriateness for the allied health professionals and students being trained. The experienced core program staff have gained commitments from departments within the Allegheny Health Network whose leaders are represented on the council of directors and will help ensure continued commitment to the project after the grant ends. </p>

<p>The Vermont SBIRT Collaborative: Changing Care Through Systems Redesign and Team-Based Training program aims to train graduate students from across several colleges and departments—medical and family residents, social workers, nurses, and counselors—over the 3 grant years. The program’s interdisciplinary approach includes online didactic skills training, workshops, and team-based training with standardized patients. Other plans include training lead faculty from each department to ensure sustainability, placing students and residents in practice settings, and delivering community SBIRT training at sites throughout Vermont. Leaders from the various departments determine where SBIRT best fits into their respective curricula and training programs. The leaders—represented on the council of directors—will help ensure continued commitment after grant funding ends. </p>
