<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fountain House has a long-term vision for incorporating technology into recovery services for members.</li>
                <li>Fountain House has a history of successful program implementation, including a federally funded research grant for a youth and young adult cognitive behavioral intervention.</li>
                <li>Fountain House intends to conduct member focus groups to obtain feedback on the utility of the mobile application.</li>
                <li>Fountain House members will be actively involved in determining how technology will support their recovery. Members will serve on an advisory committee to provide feedback on program strengths and challenges.</li>
                <li>Fountain House has in-house expertise across several specialties and content areas that can support program development needs.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The social worker assigned to work on the E-ACCESS program is no longer with the organization. Mr. Shaffer could benefit from additional staff support to assist with program design and implementation tasks.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Fountain House’s leadership believes in the value of technology to support member outcomes.</li>
	                <li>The E-ACCESS program staff demonstrates passion and drive to achieve goals.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>In the absence of a technology governance group, tasks associated with technology implementation are not prioritized, and effective implementation processes are threatened.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>E-ACCESS program staff have remained flexible in their implementation strategy and are willing to adapt delivery mechanisms as needed.</li>
	                <li>Fountain House has a multimedia department with the expertise to develop high-quality videos and other graphics-related materials that could be beneficial for program implementation.</li>
	                <li>The smartphone and mobile application are considered tools for members’ recovery toolboxes. Members are encouraged to use the technology in ways that support their individual recovery needs.</li>
	                <li>Staff plan to offer a biweekly technology support group to help members navigate the E-ACCESS app.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Implementation was delayed because Fountain House had difficulty identifying a technology vendor that could satisfy functionality requirements within budget. The budget and timeline shifted as a result.</li>
	                <li>Coordinating and prioritizing next steps for the E-ACCESS program will require a detailed project management plan guided by the governance group.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Fountain House understands the importance of identifying early adopters and champions to help move initiatives forward. It has already secured partners interested in advancing technology-based services.</li>
	                <li>Fountain House has a longstanding presence in the community and established partnerships with other provider groups including Phoenix House and the Baer Center. Its reputation and voice in the community facilitate partnership opportunities.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Fountain House has an extensive partner and referral network from which to identify and engage members in service.</li>
	                <li>There is already considerable buzz about the “free phone program.”</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li> may take time for members and partners to feel comfortable transitioning from more traditional recovery modalities. Understanding member preferences for and access to different technologies will assist in outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>

	                <li>Fountain House understands the value of technology as a tool to improve member outcomes and appreciates the role technology will have in the future of health care.</li>
	                <li>Fountain House has an established electronic health record system.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>At this time, partner sites do not have a fluid way of sharing information. Each organization uses a different EHR system.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>While program design and implementation have been the primary focus, staff are mindful of the importance of sustaining the project beyond the grant. </li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>As the program grows, there will be increased demands on staff, which may affect their ability to meet program requirements.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Fountain House utilizes an objective, independent program evaluator to support data collection and assessment efforts.</li>
	                <li>Fountain House is motivated to build technology-related questions into the evaluation model to make the case for how technology-based practices enhance client outcomes. This will be an asset for future sustainability efforts.</li>
	                <li>Fountain House has an in-house research unit that can assist with evaluation.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The E-ACCESS program is in the early design and implementation stages and does not yet have robust evaluation results to draw from.</li>
	                <li>Program workflow may need to be adjusted to accommodate the collection of GPRA and other data.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>


	<h3 class="accordion-header">Recommended Enhancements</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Program Vision and Design:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Consider expanding content to include resources that benefit clients’ lives, such as information related to employment, dealing with emotions, child welfare, or housing.</li>
	                <li>Adapt the E-ACCESS mobile application with the end user in mind. Consider the user experience to achieve the greatest potential and minimize frustration. Conducting additional and routine focus groups may help guide decisionmaking.</li>
	                <li>In addition to utilizing Fountain House’s onsite IT expertise, consider having members who are actively using the mobile application lead technology support groups and education efforts.</li>
	                <li>To best meet the needs of members using the app, consider having Fountain House’s research unit conduct a query to determine members’ access to and familiarity with technology.</li>
	                <li>Draw on the skillsets of other Fountain House units to build a cross-functional support team to strengthen the platform’s content and functionality.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Grantee Leadership:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Fountain House will benefit from forming a governance group to help prioritize enhancements designed to increase the use of technology.</li>
	                <li>Fountain House may wish to identify champions from within the organization and among members to promote the value of using technology to enhance substance abuse treatment services.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Implementation Plan:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Solicit client input at intake to better determine access to and preference for different types of technology. JBS provided sample questionnaire language that can be incorporated in the client intake forms.</li>
	                <li>Consider having members sign a contract that outlines their expectations for using the smartphone and mobile application. This may assist with member accountability and engagement.</li>
	                <li>Recruiting peer navigators will help to maximize the user experience and increase recruitment and engagement opportunities.</li>
	                <li>Developing brief video-based tutorials and member testimonials will assist with implementation and engagement efforts, particularly when in-person help is not available.</li>
	                <li>Immediate and longer term adaptations to the E-ACCESS mobile application were recommended during the program overview and consumer discussions. Below is a section-specific summary of suggested edits:

	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Affordable Care Act Readiness:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Technology will serve as the currency of health reform.

	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Grantee Evaluation:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Fountain House may wish to consider developing simple inquiries that are routinely collected to gauge the technology features that are most useful to its users.</li>
	                <li>Fountain House may wish to streamline GPRA data collection strategies to ease respondent fatigue. Organizing the progression of questions, using skip patterns, and linking responses to tailored resources may increase completion rates.</li>
	                <li>Outcomes data are essential to diversify funding. Collect evidence of program effectiveness to demonstrate why funders should reimburse for distance treatment services.</li>
	                <li>Incorporate existing resources and expertise by tapping into in-house support available from the Fountain House research unit.</li>
