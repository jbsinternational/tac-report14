    <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul>
            <li>SACADAâ€™s Web-Oriented Recovery Care (WORC) project serves individuals living in Bexar County, a minority-majority populated county, and 29 surrounding counties in South Central Texas who are seeking substance abuse treatment services. Targeted clients include individuals in rural communities with limited resources; uninsured veterans; Hispanics; and those in recovery who need additional resources to sustain their sobriety. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Project Goals</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul>
            <li>Use technology-assisted care in Bexar County and the surrounding county catchment area to enhance the ability of providers to effectively communicate with traditionally underserved persons in treatment/recovery and track and manage their health to ensure treatment and services are available when and where needed.</li>
            <li>Increase the recovery capital of the San Antonio/Bexar County and surrounding rural county areas by training a cadre of peer coaches to deliver recovery services to traditionally underserved individuals, including the uninsured, minorities, and those living in rural areas.</li>
            <li>Identify and recruit 450 underserved clients with substance use disorders over 3 years through linkage with community agencies and through the public WORC eROSC portal.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the effects of the eROSC intervention on health, wellness, and recovery of enrolled participants.</li>
