    <h3 class="accordion-header">Population Served</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul>
            <li>Community Health Center’s TEACH BMT project has made a special commitment to use technology to expand treatment and recovery services for all clients, including special needs populations and those who are uninsured and underinsured. The organization serves predominantly Hispanic and White males and females aged 20–44 with an elevated risk for opioid abuse who live in low-income and high-crime metropolitan areas.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Project Goals</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul>
            <li>To utilize novel videoconferencing technology to help educate, train, guide, and support providers in BMT and increase access and access points for patients in all communities served by CHCI.</li>
            <li>To design and implement an innovative program that integrates BMT with primary care, behavioral health, and wraparound support services. Patients who participate in CHCI's program will improve outcomes related to both substance abuse and primary health care.</li>
            <li>To engage in a unique multidisciplinary model of substance abuse care through the participation of a comprehensive health care team. The team will consist of not only the buprenorphine-prescribing medical provider, but also the nurse, medical assistant, and behavioral health specialists involved in the patient’s care. This effort will increase agency-wide understanding and help reduce the stigma surrounding BMT.</li>
            <li>To provide wraparound support services to BMT patients in an effort to assist them in remaining engaged in care.</li>
