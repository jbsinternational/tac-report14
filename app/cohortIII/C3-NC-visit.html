<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>ORNC: R&R is well organized and prepared to launch its services in the community.</li>
                <li>ECU has a longstanding history of providing treatment and recovery services to veterans in their catchment area. ORNC: R&R is one of several grant-funded projects (e.g., ECU Wounded Warrior Project) geared toward veterans. DARS also offers a certificate program in military and trauma counseling to prepare graduate-level students to work with veteran populations.</li>
                <li>ORNC: R&R has access to robust, state-of-the-art technology, including satellite connectivity and Polycom teleconferencing capabilities, on its mobile clinic.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Point-to-point technology, such as the Polycom system, offers a seamless connection between remote participants; however, it may limit the number of clients that can receive simultaneous counseling services. Low-tech, Web-based applications such as Skype require simpler equipment and can increase service delivery potential, particularly when sensitive client information is not being shared.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R program staff have strong backgrounds in behavioral health care and understand the complex biopsychosocial needs of veteran populations.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R program staff believe in the value of technology to support client health outcomes.</li>
	                <li>The program team demonstrates passion, drive, and flexibility to achieve goals.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R has a well-developed implementation plan and the technology in place to support service delivery.</li>
	                <li>Program staff have remained flexible in their implementation strategy and are willing to adapt delivery mechanisms as needed.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Approval processes within academic institutions and government agencies can be time intensive and may delay program implementation.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R does not yet have a Web-based presence that clients can access when the mobile clinic is not in their area.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ECU has aligned itself with a variety of different organizations to facilitate veteran outreach and service coordination activities. ORNC: R&R has effectively collaborated within the ECU campus network and beyond to partner with State- and local-level organizations.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R program staff have successfully identified champions from among its partners to assist with program implementation.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Technology is essential to effectively manage program activities in rural settings.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R staff have actively participated in outreach activities while awaiting the official launch of their program. Continued exposure in the community will encourage veterans to seek out their services and will help with word-of-mouth marketing campaigns.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R has met directly with veterans to understand which outreach strategies would most effectively meet their needs. Program staff are committed to asking what veterans need instead of making assumptions.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R has found that despite veterans’ precarious housing situations, veterans are connected to technology via computers at local libraries and/or cell phones.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R has an extensive partner network with identified staff available to engage clients in service.</li>
	                <li>The mobile outreach clinic improves service engagement and facilitates client handoff between systems.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Homeless populations may not have consistent phone numbers, data plans, or email addresses that would facilitate receiving information and/or access to technology-based services.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R program staff are knowledgeable about the effects ACA will have on health care delivery systems.</li>
	                <li>ACA compliance will be driven by ECU’s Division of Health Sciences (affiliated with the Brody School of Medicine and a large provider network, Vidant Health System).</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R staff understand the value of distance treatment technology on client outcomes and appreciate the role technology will have on the future of patient care.</li>
	                <li>ECU is in the process of converting its electronic health record system to the Epic platform. This system has the capacity to meet continuity of care requirements mandated by Meaningful Use (stages 1 and 2).</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ECU is cautious about protecting client privacy. HIPAA considerations have somewhat delayed program implementation.</li>
	                <li>The VA and Department of Defense are currently integrating their electronic health record systems (VistA and AHLTA, respectively). This is a massive undertaking, but it will enable ECU’s system (Epic) to view and add client records.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>While implementation has been their primary focus, staff are mindful of the importance of sustaining the project beyond the grant.</li>
	                <li>To promote long-term sustainability, ORNC: R&R program staff are developing policies and procedures to provide direction to current and future cohorts of students responsible for assisting with service delivery.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R does not seek third-party reimbursement to provide counseling services. This allows for greater flexibility and keeps the clinic’s overhead costs to a minimum.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R has the appropriate technical and clinical infrastructure to build on existing program offerings.</li>
	                <li>ECU’s Department of Psychiatric Medicine has plans to expand telepsychiatry for the entire State.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>As the program grows, there will be increased demand on staff; this may affect the ability to meet program requirements.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R offers incentives to clients to encourage continued program participation. </li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R does not yet have evaluation results to draw from.</li>
	                <li>Program workflow may need to be adjusted to accommodate the collection of GPRA data.</li>
	                <li>Long-term GPRA followup may be challenging because of the transient nature of homeless veterans. Obtaining multiple points of contact information and/or identifying usual places clients spend time will be essential to meeting followup target rates.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>


	<h3 class="accordion-header">Recommended Enhancements</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Program Vision and Design</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R may benefit from adapting its workflow to (1) establish a routine travel schedule for the mobile clinic, (2) manage increased client enrollment, and (3) complete data collection requirements. Attention to these details will be particularly important to support program growth.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R may wish to pare down its rollout of different technologies and consider a phased approach that incorporates low-tech options to meet immediate needs, while still protecting client information.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Grantee Leadership</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Continue to identify champions within ECU, across partner organizations, and among clients to promote the value of using technology to enhance substance abuse treatment services.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Implementation Plan</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Social media platforms such as Facebook are popular ways to promote program activities. Consider using these tools to announce van routes/schedules and other special events.</li>
	                <li>There are many recovery-centered resources that clients can access in addition to the ones currently offered through A-CHESS. Consider linking to resources such as the In the Rooms portal, My Spiritual Toolkit, the Recovery App, PTSD Coach, and other motivational podcasts.</li>
	                <li>Develop a plan to offer free or low-cost smartphones to clients so they may access A-CHESS and/or other mobile and texting applications.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R may wish to consider developing a “newcomers” guide to introduce clients to the program. It could include video testimonials from fellow veterans who have benefitted from using ORNC: R&R services.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R may benefit from developing a detailed workplan that captures best practices for streamlining staff workflow and continuity of care strategies for clients who are transitioning to different service providers/agencies.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R may wish to use technology as an outreach and engagement tool, in addition to encouraging client retention. Diversified forms of technology can benefit clients even before they are formally enrolled in services.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R may wish to adjust its workflow to enhance engagement strategies.</li>
	                <li>The program may benefit from identifying clients who have had success in their own recovery to serve as champions to others.</li>
	                <li>Texting may serve as an effective marketing mechanism to spread the word about ORNC: R&R and to complement other outreach activities. Consider incorporating “thought-of-the-day” or other motivational messages as part of engagement and retention strategies.</li>
	                <li>Consider offering vouchers to local vendors for food, clothing, and other services not only to engage clients but to encourage continued participation.</li>
	                <li>Consider using recovery coaches in the field to enhance program capacity.</li>
	                <li>Use technology to market technology’s potential to improve client health outcomes.</li>
	                <li>Developing a fact-or-fiction handout related to accessing services might help to dispel inaccurate information circulating among veterans about wait times or fees at VA offices.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Affordable Care Act Readiness</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Technology will serve as the currency of ACA reform. Consider using the ORNC: R&R program as a way to demonstrate technology’s effectiveness in improving health outcomes for clients outside static clinical settings.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Sustainability Planning</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Sustainability planning should begin early and include a focus on workforce and financial strategies that can support the program beyond the life of the grant. Develop a strategic plan for the next several years with a focus on how the program will adapt to the technology requirements outlined under ACA.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R may wish to expand its menu of technology options beyond the A-CHESS smartphone application. Consider developing a client portal and incorporating other goal-setting tools that can assist clients with their treatment plans.</li>
	                <li>Training recovery coaches to promote the program will help to embed the program in the community and reduce strain on staff.</li>
	                <li>Demonstrate the value of technology in supporting broader ECU initiatives by showcasing ORNC: R&R’s cost-benefit and savings potential.</li>
	                <li>Develop efficient work policies, and ensure staff are operating at the top end of their licenses.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Grantee Evaluation</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>It may be beneficial to consider collecting additional data beyond GPRA requirements. Include questions that capture clients’ use of and satisfaction with technology.</li>
	                <li>ORNC: R&R may wish to streamline data collection strategies to ease respondent fatigue. Organizing the progression of questions, using skip patterns, and linking responses to tailored resources may increase completion rates.</li>
	                <li>Consider developing simple inquiries to gauge the technology features that are most useful to users. Use the data to develop a menu of options for clients to tap into.</li>
	                <li>Outcomes data are essential to diversify funding. Collect evidence of program effectiveness to demonstrate why distance treatment services should be funded in the future.</li>
	            </ul>
