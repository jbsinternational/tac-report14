<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Centerstone has an extensive history of leveraging different technologies to enhance client care and program operations. For example, the facility has been paperless since 2003. Its management and staff routinely use EHRs, analytics, and other technology to track outcomes across substance use programs.</li>
                <li>Centerstone has longstanding experience with health information technology. The organization implemented an EHR system 13 years ago. It is currently undergoing changes for stage 2 meaningful use certification.</li>
                <li>Centerstone has a well-supported history of successful program implementation at local, State, and Federal levels, including the SAMSHA-funded grant REALives, a program that serves racial and ethnic minorities struggling with substance use or co-occurring mental health disorders and HIV/AIDS.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clients may have unreliable Internet connections or other limitations that limit their ability to access health information technology applications. TN e-ROSC plans to provide equipment and training to clients as needed.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Centerstoneâ€™s leadership believes in the value of technology to support patient outcomes.</li>
	                <li>The TN e-ROSC program team demonstrates passion and drive to achieve goals.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>In the absence of a technology governance group, tasks associated with technology implementation are not prioritized, and effective implementation processes are threatened.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>TN e-ROSC program staff have remained flexible in their implementation strategy and are willing to adapt delivery mechanisms as needed.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>TN e-ROSC does not have the e-ROSC portal technology actively in place at this time but is working toward revising a Web site, developing a patient portal, and launching telehealth services.</li>
	                <li>Providers that prefer traditional face-to-face client encounters are less inclined to incorporate technology into their practice; implementation will require additional time and staff and client education to overcome such reluctance.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Centerstone of Tennessee has received ongoing consultation and assistance from partner organization Centerstone of Indiana.</li>
	                <li>Centerstone of Tennessee has a longstanding presence in the community and established partnerships with multiple Federal, State, and local agencies. Its reputation and voice in the community facilitate partnership opportunities.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Technology competence among community partners and other Centerstone substance use providers varies greatly. TN e-ROSC plans to develop a training protocol and have recovery coaches facilitate adoption of new technologies.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>TN e-ROSC has an extensive partner and referral network from which to identify and engage clients in service.</li>
	                <li>Recovery coaches are instrumental in fostering relationships with clients and partners to help them understand the value of participating in TN e-ROSC.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>It may take time for clients and partners to feel comfortable transitioning from more traditional treatment modalities to technology platforms. Understanding client preferences for and access to different technologies will assist in outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Centerstone of Tennessee program staff are knowledgeable about the effects ACA will have on health care delivery systems. As one of the largest service providers in the State, the organization is actively preparing to meet meaningful use requirements.</li>
	                <li>Centerstone of Tennessee understands the value of distance treatment technology on client outcomes and appreciates the role technology will have on the future of patient care. As a long-time user and supporter of technology, Centerstone of Tennessee will continue to refine its processes to meet technology requirements.</li>
	                <li>Centerstone of Tennessee has an established EHR system through Netsmart, which is currently undergoing modifications to comply with meaningful use stage 2 requirements.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Integrating primary care and behavioral health systems across the State is a goal for Centerstone of Tennessee. Facilities are in various stages of EHR readiness.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Centerstone of Tennessee understands the value of distance treatment technology on client outcomes and appreciates the role technology will have on the future of patient care.</li>
	                <li>While program design and implementation have been the primary focus, staff are mindful of the importance of sustaining the project beyond the grant.</li>
	                <li>TN e-ROSC can draw from the lessons learned from Centerstone of Indiana partners to determine which features translate into sustainable practices.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>As the program grows, there will be increased demands on staff, which may affect their ability to meet program requirements.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>TN e-ROSC evaluation is led by CRI, which has worked on several successful SAMHSA-funded evaluations.</li>
	                <li>TN e-ROSC plans to offer incentives to clients to encourage continued program participation and the completion of followup reporting requirements.</li>
	                <li>TN e-ROSC is motivated to build technology-related questions into the evaluation model to make the case for how technology-based practices enhance client outcomes. This will be an asset for future sustainability efforts.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>TN e-RSOC program is in the early design and implementation stages and does not yet have robust evaluation results to draw from.</li>
	                <li>Program workflow may need to be adjusted to accommodate the collection of GPRA and other data elements.</li>
	            </ul>
