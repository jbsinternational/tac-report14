    <h3 class="accordion-header">Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <h4>Program Vision and Design</h4>
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The BU team has experience implementing Federal grant awards, including several SAMHSA-funded programs. The team has also adapted other technologies for Latino patients with co-occurring disorders.</li>
                <li>Casa Esperanza has a long-term vision for incorporating technology into recovery services for clients.</li>
                <li>Casa Esperanza intends to conduct client focus groups to obtain feedback on the utility of the mobile application and serve as a continuous quality improvement mechanism.</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Challenges</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The case manager originally assigned to the project is leaving the organization; however, another case manager has been identified and will be trained to take over project responsibilities.</li>
                <li>A-CHESS developers created a separate platform for the CASA CHESS application that contains content in Spanish. This may be an issue for clients with varied language proficiency skills, particularly those who read and write only in English.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Grantee Leadership</h4>
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>BU and Casa Esperanza leadership believe in the value of technology to support member outcomes.</li>
                <li>CASA CHESS program staff demonstrate passion and drive to achieve goals.</li>
                <li>Casa Esperanza has an active consumer advisory board that helps to develop, assess, and promote programs that meet client needs.</li>
                <li>Technology is improving leadership and accountability skills among clients.</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Chalenges</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>In the absence of a technology governance group, tasks associated with technology implementation are not prioritized, integrated, or aligned, and effective implementation processes are threatened.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Implementation Plan</h4>
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The smartphone and mobile application are considered tools for clients’ recovery toolboxes. Clients are encouraged to use the technology in ways that support their individual recovery needs.</li>
                <li>Clients use their peer support network and case manager as points of contact for the panic button feature. Clients reported that having someone who understands what they are going through is invaluable.</li>
                <li>Clinicians reported a decrease in missed appointments as a result of using mobile technology. The smartphone has been a helpful way to expand communication opportunities with clients, clinicians, and other support members.</li>
                <li>BU and Casa Esperanza program staff have remained flexible in their implementation strategy and are willing to adapt delivery mechanisms as needed.</li>
                <li>Casa Esperanza uses recovery coaches to help achieve an excellent user experience and increase recruitment and engagement opportunities.</li>
                <li>As part of the case management approach, Casa Esperanza gives clients access to a computer lab to help them learn basic computer skills and access employment sites.</li><li>BU and A-CHESS developers are in the process of making Spanish-language video tutorials (e.g., YouTube) that outline on how to use the smartphone and mobile application.</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Challenges</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Coordinating and prioritizing next steps for the CASA CHESS program will require a detailed project management plan guided by the governance group.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h4>
            <h5>Strengths</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Casa Esperanza has a longstanding presence in the community and established partnerships with multiple Federal, State, and local agencies. Its reputation and voice in the community facilitate partnership opportunities, especially with groups serving Latinos.</li>
                    <li>Casa Esperanza uses recovery coaches to facilitate program adoption.</li>
                    <li>BU and Casa Esperanza have connected with a fellow TCE-TAC cohort 1 grantee, Advocates, Inc. (located in Ayer, Massachusetts), to aim for the best possible client service delivery.</li>
                </ul>
             <h5>Challenges</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>None noted.</li>
                </ul>
        <h4>Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h4>
             <h5>Strenghts</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>CASA Esperanza recruits clients receiving on-campus residential treatment services. Close proximity to clients on a daily basis facilitates outreach and recruitment efforts.</li>
                    <ul>There is already considerable buzz about the “free phone program” among clients.</li>
                    <li>During the consumer discussion, clients commented on the value and utility of having access to a smartphone with preloaded support tools.</li>
                </ul>
              <h5>Challenges</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>It may take time for clients to feel comfortable transitioning from more traditional treatment modalities to technology platforms. Understanding client preferences for and access to different technologies will assist in outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts.</li>
                </ul>
        <h4>Affordable Care Act Readiness</h4>
             <h5>Strenghts</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Massachusetts has taken a progressive stand toward expanding health care services to its residents. The State served as the model for the national health care platform (i.e., ACA). As a result, Casa Esperanza is prepared to address changes outlined under ACA.</li>
                    <li>Casa Esperanza understands the value of distance treatment technology on client outcomes and appreciates the role technology will have in the future of patient care.</li>
                    <li>Casa Esperanza is preparing to launch an EHR system and patient portal through the Netsmart product.</li>
                </ul>
              <h5>Challenges</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>None noted.</li>
                </ul>
        <h4>Sustainability Planning</h4>
             <h5>Strenghts</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>From the onset, BU and Casa Esperanza have considered sustainable practices as part of the program’s design.</li>
                    <li>BU and Casa Esperanza is an active member of the A-CHESS consortium and is prepared to ask questions related to short- and long-term functionality and sustainability.</li>
                    <li>BU and Casa Esperanza can draw from the lessons learned from fellow TAC programs in cohorts 1 and 2 (e.g., Advocates, Inc.) to determine which features translate into sustainable practices.</li>
                </ul>
              <h5>Challenges</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>CASA CHESS is operated on a separate A-CHESS platform and housed on the University of Wisconsin’s server. Since competencies across reading, writing, and speaking are different, housing the app on a platform that does not contain bilingual content may hinder future scalability considerations.</li>
                    <li>Casa Esperanza is preparing to launch an EHR system and client portal. It will be important to consider design elements for both to avoid competition and duplication between the platforms.</li>
                </ul>
        <h4>Grantee Evaluation</h4>
             <h5>Strenghts</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>In addition to collecting GPRA data, BU staff will conduct a process and outcome evaluation to inform future program activities. The outcome evaluation consists of a randomized controlled study that examines clients that received the technology intervention and those that received traditional treatment services.</li>
                    <li>Casa Esperanza offers incentives to clients to encourage continued program participation and the completion of followup reporting requirements.</li>
                    <li>Casa Esperanza staff are motivated to build technology-related questions into their evaluation model to make the case for how technology-based practices enhance client outcomes. This will be an asset for future sustainability efforts.</li>
                </ul>
              <h5>Challenges</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>A-CHESS does not provide comprehensive analytics related to how clients are using the instrument; therefore, program staff do not have a complete picture on how the technology is being used.</li>
                </ul>
                                      
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Recommended Enhancements</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <h4>Program Vision and Design</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Adapt the CASA CHESS mobile application with the end user in mind. Consider the user experience to achieve the greatest potential and least frustration. Conducting additional routine focus groups may help guide decisionmaking.</li>
                <li>Consider having clients who are actively using the mobile application lead technology support groups and education efforts.</li>
                <li>As program enrollment expands, it may be necessary to reevaluate the provider-to-client ratio to most effectively manage caseloads and user activity on the app.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Grantee Leadership</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Casa Esperanza will benefit from forming a governance group to help prioritize enhancements designed to increase the use of technology.</li>
                <li>Casa Esperanza may wish to identify champions from within the organization and among clients to promote the value of using technology to enhance substance abuse treatment services.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Implementation Plan</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Clients reported that having a goal/objective tracking feature for a range of issues within and outside of their program treatment plan on the CASA CHESS app would be helpful.</li>
                <li>Solicit client input at intake to better determine access to and preference for different types of technology.</li>
                <li>Establish a detailed project management plan to help set expectations for the app’s functionality, prioritize the adaptation and rollout of features, and identify a budget and timeline.</li>
                <li>During the technology and information strategic planning process, consider expanding content of portals and/or CASA CHESS to include resources that benefit clients’ lives, such as information related to education, employment, housing, and child welfare. Content must be relevant and easy to find.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Collect qualitative and quantitative data to share with potential partners about the program’s value and effectiveness.</li>
                <li>A detailed workplan may help capture best practices for streamlining staff workflow and continuity-of-care strategies for clients transitioning to different service providers.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The program may benefit from identifying clients who have had success using technology in their own recovery to serve as champions to others.</li>
                <li>Texting may serve as an effective marketing mechanism to spread the word about CASA CHESS and to complement other outreach activities. Consider incorporating “thought-of-the-day” or other motivational messages as part of engagement and retention strategies.</li>
                <li>Develop a strategic marketing campaign that uses technology (e.g., brief videos) to market technology’s potential to improve client health outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Affordable Care Act Readiness</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Technology will serve as the currency of health reform. Consider using the Casa Esperanza program as a way to demonstrate technology’s effectiveness in improving health outcomes for clients outside static clinical settings. This may help to make the case for needed reimbursement reform.</li>
                <li>Casa Esperanza may wish to consider joining local chapters of health informatics groups to gain perspective on how the organization can position its use of technology in the changing health care landscape.</li>
                <li>As accountable care organization models expand and shift to primary care based approaches in response to the ACA, it will be important for Casa Esperanza to stay on top of these developments and demonstrate the value of early intervention and improved client engagement. Ongoing technology enhancements that align with this need to be guided by an organizational information plan.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Sustainability Planning</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Sustainability planning should begin early and include a focus on workforce and financial strategies that can support the program beyond the life of the grant. Develop a strategic plan for the next several years with a focus on how the program will adapt to the technology and population health goals outlined under ACA.</li>
                <li>Training recovery coaches to promote the program will help embed the program in the recovery community and reduce strain on staff.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate the value of technology in supporting other Casa Esperanza initiatives by showcasing the program’s cost-benefit and savings potential. Data-driven results will assist in making the case for expanding funding mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Casa Esperanza should develop a decision support tool that the governance group can use to guide short- and long-term decisionmaking.</li>
                <li>Utilize the A-CHESS consortium to make a collective request for necessary changes to the tool’s functionality.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Grantee Evaluation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Outcomes data is essential to solicit and diversify funding for sustainability purposes. Collect evidence of program effectiveness and efficiency to demonstrate why distance treatment services should be reimbursed in the future.</li>
                <li>BU may wish to consider developing simple inquiries that are routinely collected to gauge the technology features that are most useful to users.</li>
                <li>Ensure that the randomized study provides an equal amount of client support time to the control group so that a more accurate comparison can be made.</li>It might be helpful to stagger treatment and control groups by several months to avoid conflict between clients who received a phone and those who did not.</li>

                    <li>Casa Esperanza staff are motivated to build technology-related questions into their evaluation model to make the case for how technology-based practices enhance client outcomes. This will be an asset for future sustainability efforts.</li>
                </ul>
              <h5>Challenges</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>A-CHESS does not provide comprehensive analytics related to how clients are using the instrument; therefore, program staff do not have a complete picture on how the technology is being used.</li>
                </ul>
                                      
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Recommended Enhancements</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <h4>Program Vision and Design</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Adapt the CASA CHESS mobile application with the end user in mind. Consider the user experience to achieve the greatest potential and least frustration. Conducting additional routine focus groups may help guide decisionmaking.</li>
                <li>Consider having clients who are actively using the mobile application lead technology support groups and education efforts.</li>
                <li>As program enrollment expands, it may be necessary to reevaluate the provider-to-client ratio to most effectively manage caseloads and user activity on the app.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Grantee Leadership</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Casa Esperanza will benefit from forming a governance group to help prioritize enhancements designed to increase the use of technology.</li>
                <li>Casa Esperanza may wish to identify champions from within the organization and among clients to promote the value of using technology to enhance substance abuse treatment services.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Implementation Plan</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Clients reported that having a goal/objective tracking feature for a range of issues within and outside of their program treatment plan on the CASA CHESS app would be helpful.</li>
                <li>Solicit client input at intake to better determine access to and preference for different types of technology.</li>
                <li>Establish a detailed project management plan to help set expectations for the app’s functionality, prioritize the adaptation and rollout of features, and identify a budget and timeline.</li>
                <li>During the technology and information strategic planning process, consider expanding content of portals and/or CASA CHESS to include resources that benefit clients’ lives, such as information related to education, employment, housing, and child welfare. Content must be relevant and easy to find.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Collect qualitative and quantitative data to share with potential partners about the program’s value and effectiveness.</li>
                <li>A detailed workplan may help capture best practices for streamlining staff workflow and continuity-of-care strategies for clients transitioning to different service providers.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The program may benefit from identifying clients who have had success using technology in their own recovery to serve as champions to others.</li>
                <li>Texting may serve as an effective marketing mechanism to spread the word about CASA CHESS and to complement other outreach activities. Consider incorporating “thought-of-the-day” or other motivational messages as part of engagement and retention strategies.</li>
                <li>Develop a strategic marketing campaign that uses technology (e.g., brief videos) to market technology’s potential to improve client health outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Affordable Care Act Readiness</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Technology will serve as the currency of health reform. Consider using the Casa Esperanza program as a way to demonstrate technology’s effectiveness in improving health outcomes for clients outside static clinical settings. This may help to make the case for needed reimbursement reform.</li>
                <li>Casa Esperanza may wish to consider joining local chapters of health informatics groups to gain perspective on how the organization can position its use of technology in the changing health care landscape.</li>
                <li>As accountable care organization models expand and shift to primary care based approaches in response to the ACA, it will be important for Casa Esperanza to stay on top of these developments and demonstrate the value of early intervention and improved client engagement. Ongoing technology enhancements that align with this need to be guided by an organizational information plan.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Sustainability Planning</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Sustainability planning should begin early and include a focus on workforce and financial strategies that can support the program beyond the life of the grant. Develop a strategic plan for the next several years with a focus on how the program will adapt to the technology and population health goals outlined under ACA.</li>
                <li>Training recovery coaches to promote the program will help embed the program in the recovery community and reduce strain on staff.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate the value of technology in supporting other Casa Esperanza initiatives by showcasing the program’s cost-benefit and savings potential. Data-driven results will assist in making the case for expanding funding mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Casa Esperanza should develop a decision support tool that the governance group can use to guide short- and long-term decisionmaking.</li>
                <li>Utilize the A-CHESS consortium to make a collective request for necessary changes to the tool’s functionality.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Grantee Evaluation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Outcomes data is essential to solicit and diversify funding for sustainability purposes. Collect evidence of program effectiveness and efficiency to demonstrate why distance treatment services should be reimbursed in the future.</li>
                <li>BU may wish to consider developing simple inquiries that are routinely collected to gauge the technology features that are most useful to users.</li>
                <li>Ensure that the randomized study provides an equal amount of client support time to the control group so that a more accurate comparison can be made.</li>It might be helpful to stagger treatment and control groups by several months to avoid conflict between clients who received a phone and those who did not.</li>
