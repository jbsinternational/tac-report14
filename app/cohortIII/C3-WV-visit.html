<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Located in a renovated motel, the Prestera Center supports short- and long-term residential housing for individuals and women and children with a range of outpatient programming. This model allows Prestera to provide a continuum of care from inpatient to outpatient.</li>
                <li>The program uses wellness coaches to help clients in recovery.</li>
                <li>The consumer-driven model involves consumers as part of Prestera’s board of directors.</li>
                <li>The agency is focused on moving toward “whole health,” providing information not only for clients, but the community and providers as well.</li>
                <li>The long-term goal of the agency is to provide in-home services (i.e., for clients in judicial services who are homebound).</li>
                <li>Several counselors have completed distance counseling certification.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>None noted.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Leadership supports cross-functional operations and believes implementation should involve collaboration across all involved departments.</li>
	                <li>Leadership believes in investing in technology and employing the strengths of the IT department.</li>
	                <li>Leadership is involved in State committees and partnerships helping to develop policies conducive to improved access to services.</li>
	                <li>Leadership believes the program’s focus should be not only on behavioral health but integration, engagement, and a continuum of care.</li>
	                <li>The leadership is holding the vendor Qualifacts accountable for lack of responsiveness.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The preexisting telemedicine system helped spur use of telehealth for the grant program. At least one of the clinicians is also experienced with telemedicine.</li>
	                <li>Upgrading the existing telemedicine system has enabled operability across platforms; servers and tablets have been set up and bandwidth expanded.</li>
	                <li>The One Health application is a useful tool for supplementing recovery and is accessible from both kiosks/computers and mobile phones.</li>
	                <li>A monthly report is provided to Prestera regarding the One Health activity, which informs clinicians about client needs and preferences.</li>
	                <li>The program has a portal called My Health; the team is currently working to expand the portal capabilities.</li>
	                <li>Integration and interoperability are major goals of the program; leadership understands both are necessary to achieve an effective program.</li>
	                <li>The agency is working toward developing a more dynamic Web site. Development has begun and should be live by June 2014.</li>
	                <li>Prestera has a “Readily at Hand” directory that is full of helpful resources.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The agency does not have access to the One Health activity analytics, so evaluation is limited to only the monthly information received.</li>
	                <li>The vendor (Qualifacts) is not delivering functionalities for the portal upgrade (i.e., medication information, ACA factors such as client termination and access).</li>
	                <li>The vendor lost meaningful use certification, which is a detrimental to progress.</li>
	                <li>The bandwidth and interest in the portal are challenges that prevent clients from registering.</li>
	                <li>Some staff are hesitant to use telehealth technology.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">

	                <li>Each employee plays a vital role in outreach and educating the community on the programs and services at Prestera.</li>
	                <li>Referrals are made to Prestera from other agencies, and referrals are made from Prestera to external agencies. This exchange fosters trusted partnerships.</li>
	            </ul>

	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Some members of the leadership team are knowledgeable about ACA and have brought attention to the board of directors regarding opportunities and challenges ACA presents for Prestera.</li>
	                <li>The state of West Virginia is involved in ACA readiness and health homes.</li>
	                <li>Leadership is well versed in implications of the ACA.</li>
	            </ul>

	                <li>Prestera’s board of directors does not yet understand the importance of ACA.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The grantee is interested in moving toward in-home telehealth capabilities to reach more individuals seeking recovery and treatment. This will help expand the reach of the program.</li>
	                <li>The State of West Virginia is involved in focusing efforts on ACA and health homes.</li>
	            </ul>

	                <li>There is currently no plan for sustainability.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Prestera is using technology to obtain client data used to help improve the design and implementation of the program.</li>
	                <li>The program employs satisfaction surveys and assessment of health risk factors in program implementation.</li>
	                <li>Analytics are provided for the use of the One Health and My Health portals.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>GPRA data are difficult to collect from clients because clients are disinterested in providing the information, regardless of an incentive.</li>
	                <li>The agency lacks a clinical decision support tool to provide real-time information and knowledge transfer on enhancing health outcomes for clients, patient satisfaction, and operational efficiencies.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>


	<h3 class="accordion-header">Recommended Enhancements</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Program Vision and Design</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Design the program to minimize time between intake and treatment initiation by integrating the GPRA questions into the assessment process.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Grantee Leadership</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Both the clinical and technical staff need to understand meaningful use and its implications.</li>
	                <li>Consider developing a roadmap to help other West Virginia providers come together and work toward a common goal. A consortium of providers can help relieve some of the stresses and costs of implementing an EHR.</li>
	                <li>Consider working with the Medicaid office to understand and provide input to the ACA implementation strategy and determine how Prestera can align its goals with those of the Medicaid office.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Implementation Plan</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Vendor selection should begin with the team (clinical and technical) working together to develop use cases. Contracts should include clauses for penalties when the system is down and deliverable timelines are not met.</li>
	                <li>Explore the Mid-Atlantic Telehealth Resource Center for West Virginia: http://matrc.org/telehealth-resource-centers</li>
	                <li>It is important that the Web site is dynamic, incorporating videos and other helpful resources. The content should be easy to update and change as necessary.</li>
	                <li>Consider developing a page of frequently asked questions on the Web site to help avoid having clients send direct emails to staff.</li>
	                <li>Google analytics are important to build into the requirements of the Web site.</li>
	                <li>Develop a cross-functional IT governance group to address and prioritize issues.</li>
	                <li>Consider overcoming lack of interest in portal use by developing videos to engage clients in the capabilities the portal offers.</li>
	                <li>Addressing client behavior change in the implementation of the program is key to helping clients recover.</li>
	                <li>Develop an organizational information strategy addressing both the business and clinical areas, and develop a written plan.</li>
	                <li>Using champions to support peer-to-peer technology adoption is a critical success factor.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Consider featuring a technology demonstration to the State Medicaid Office to help the agency recognize the value of this technology in improving access to and compliance with treatment.</li>

	        <p><b>Affordable Care Act Readiness</b></p>

	                <li>Determine how technology facilitates health reform and the agency’s needs.</li>
	                <li>Encourage staff to become knowledgeable in all aspects of the ACA and meaningful use to support the agency in strategy- and capacity-building.</li>

	            <ul>
