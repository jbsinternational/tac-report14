<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The program employs NIH’s evidence-based standard of 90 “doses” of contact with clients within a 90-day period to maintain constant communication and engagement.</li>
                <li>Recovery coaches are used as needed. The coaches are often volunteers and part of the on-call staff.</li>
                <li>Online social network applications are used to incentivize aftercare/continuing care and engagement.</li>
                <li>The online accessibility gives clients the opportunity to be part of the social network even if they are not local to Bismarck. The ease in accessing the network has also overcome the digital divide barrier.</li>
                <li>The agency is diverse and experienced, providing both inpatient and outpatient services, as well as BMT.</li>
                <li>The program has monthly social events to increase engagement with clients.</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Challenges</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Some clients are still hesitant in using the online social network application due to apprehension about privacy and unfamiliarity with technology use</li>
            </ul>
