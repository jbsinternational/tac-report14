<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meta House has experience implementing Federal grant awards, including several SAMHSA-funded programs.</li>
                <li>Meta House has a long-term vision for incorporating technology into recovery services for clients.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meta House has focused primarily on launching the Epitomax EHR system, which is used exclusively by Meta House staff. It has not expanded client-based technology offerings beyond recommending mobile applications. Adoption of client-centered tools will take additional time and resources.</li>
                <li>The original MIS director left the organization, resulting in a gap in IT services; however, another director was identified and is moving forward with technology enhancements and beginning to think broadly about technology implications for the organization.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Leadership understands the value of data as a way to support client outcomes. The program manager has an extensive programming and evaluation background to help inform system enhancements and data collection strategy.</li>
	                <li>Healthy Connections staff appear strongly committed to achieving goals.</li>
	                <li>The Meta House president and chief executive officer is a lawyer. Her contractual expertise was particularly helpful when negotiating the vendor terms with PsyTech to use the Epitomax EHR system.</li>
	                <li>Meta House has a medical records specialist to help organize the transition from paper-based to electronic health recordkeeping.</li>
	                <li>Meta House has open feedback loops. Leadership responds well to incorporating and reacting to feedback for improvements in delivering care.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>In the absence of a technology governance group, tasks associated with technology implementation are not prioritized, integrated, or aligned, and effective implementation processes are threatened.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Meta House has allocated dollars to cover the cost of purchasing smartphone mobile applications so that clients have more opportunities to engage with technology.</li>
	                <li>PsyTech is a relatively small technology company, which makes access to helpdesk support easy. To facilitate internal system adoption, Meta House established a formal helpdesk process.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Coordinating and prioritizing next steps for Healthy Connections will require a detailed project management plan guided by a user group and governance group.</li>
	                <li>As technology and program participation expand, so will the need to restructure workflow. Without a formal workflow plan in place, staff run the risk of becoming overwhelmed.</li>
	                <li>Changing established practices also means shifting attitudes and behaviors among clinical and administrative staff. Counselors have been somewhat less motivated to adopt new technology.</li>
	                <li>It has been challenging to implement new technology when there are issues related to Internet connectivity, cell reception, firewall restrictions, and outdated equipment.</li>
	                <li>PsyTech has been busy implementing ICD-10 changes to replace ICD-9 as the HIPAA adopted coding structure. This activity has delayed progress on developing other client-focused technology platforms, like a portal.</li>
	                <li>EHR adoption dramatically impacts workflow during the early implementation phase, which can lead to a decline in productivity and staff acceptance.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Meta House has a longstanding presence in the community and established partnerships with multiple Federal, State, and local agencies. Its reputation and voice in the community facilitate partnership opportunities, especially among groups serving women.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Clients commented on the value and utility of technology in supporting their treatment and recovery.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>It may take time for some clients to feel comfortable transitioning from more traditional recovery modalities.</li>
	                <li>Understanding client preferences for and access to different technologies will assist in outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Meta House understands the value of distance treatment technology on client outcomes and appreciates the role technology will have in the future of patient care. </li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Wisconsin is not a Medicaid expansion State and has not implemented an HIE.</li>
	                <li>Meta House will need to expand its technology to include a way for clients to communicate with providers.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>While implementation has been their primary focus, staff are mindful of the importance of sustaining the project beyond the grant.</li>
	                <li>Meta House has a strong fundraising legacy and has secured funding from various sources including the United Way and county, State, and Federal grants.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Meta House has not billed extensively for services delivered to clients. Instead, it has relied on grant funding to cover costs.</li>
	                <li>Billing and reimbursement is complex, especially with multiple Medicaid managed care payers in the State. Each payer has varying payment requirements, which can be challenging to coordinate. It has been a significant process to determine which services will be covered.</li>
	                <li>The Epitomax system has helped streamline billing information; however, staff are hesitant to use the system to coordinate billing until it can fully accommodate all of the billing variations related to the multiple payers.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Meta House uses an objective, independent program evaluator to support data collection and assessment efforts. As a seasoned evaluator, IMPACT has developed effective strategies to collect meaningful data on program activities.</li>
	                <li>IMPACT has been consistently close to the 80 percent followup threshold on all Federal grants requiring GRPA assessments.</li>
	                <li>Staff have taken steps to consolidate assessment questions to avoid having clients respond to redundant questions.</li>
	                <li>There are regular opportunities to collect information and to have real-time feedback on program effectiveness and areas for improvement.</li>
	                <li>Data will help to demonstrate the return on investment and client outcomes facilitated by technology.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Adjust workflow to accommodate collection of GPRA and other data.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	                <li>Consider using the Healthy Connections program as a way to demonstrate technology’s effectiveness in improving health outcomes for clients outside static clinical settings to help make the case for needed reimbursement reform.</li>
	                <li>As accountable care organization models expand and shift to primary care based approaches in response to the ACA, it will be important for Meta House to stay on top of these developments and demonstrate the value of early intervention and improved client engagement. Ongoing technology enhancements that align with this need to be guided by an organizational information plan.</li>Stay informed about ACA developments and demonstrate the value of early intervention and improved client engagement.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Sustainability Planning:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Sustainability planning should begin early and include a focus on workforce and financial strategies that can support the program beyond the life of the grant. Develop a strategic plan for the next several years with a focus on how the program will adapt to the technology requirements outlined under the ACA and HITECH Act.</li>
	                <li>Demonstrate the value of technology to support broader Meta House initiatives by showcasing the program’s cost-benefit and savings potential. Data-driven results will assist in making the case for expanding funding mechanisms. An economist may be able to frame the case for payers’ consideration.</li>
	                <li>Develop a decision support tool that the governance group can use to guide short- and long-term decisionmaking. A technology wish list should coincide with Meta House’s expansion goals for the next 3–5 years. It is essential for leadership to be involved in the strategic planning process.</li>
	                <li>Build a robust Web presence to house training materials and other resources that clients and partners can access on a regular basis.</li>
	                <li>Explore reimbursement options for providing clinical services (e.g., case management, counseling, telehealth services), including bundled treatment options.</li>
	                <li>Consider seeking designation as a Significant Traditional Provider.</li>
	                <li>Negotiate with payers (like Anthem) to expand coverage to align with other carriers in the network. In doing so, demonstrate the cost savings associated with covering nonlicensed professionals.</li>
	                <li>Seek support from the State’s provider association, Medicaid office, and other policy leaders, like the Department of Insurance, to support expanded coverage and reimbursement options.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Grantee Evaluation:</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Collect evidence of program effectiveness to demonstrate why distance treatment services should be reimbursed in the future.</li>
	                <li>Develop simple inquiries that are routinely collected to gauge the technology features that are most useful to users.</li>
	                <li>Use Epitomax data to inform clinical outcomes and determine what strategies might need to be shifted/improved. Data can be used to determine risk level at intake, vulnerability to crises, and the types of interventions needed to reduce risks.</li>
	                <li>Start thinking about collecting data elements as opposed to simply using assessment tools. Data elements are computable while forms are not.</li>
	                <li>Collect information that supports good clinical decisionmaking. Avoid collecting data that will not be useful.</li>
