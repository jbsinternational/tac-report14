<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The TEACH BMT program is based on the ECHO model, which CHCI has used for other programs. ECHO is a low-cost, reproducible intervention.</li>
                <li>The ECHO model is a “force multiplier.” Staff meet with clients, and provider training helps expand services and reach more potential clients.</li>
                <li>Patient navigators help individuals transition into the BMT program. An experienced navigator acts as a champion for assisting patients with access to services.</li>
                <li>A team-based, interdisciplinary, collaborative model of care called a pod is used to help improve treatment outcomes.</li>
                <li>A voucher system stresses team work and the importance of the relationship between the client and clinical team providers, and it holds patients accountable for their own recovery process.</li>
                <li>The agency employs a warm hand-off model that enables real-time consults by the pod team, providing the client with an opportunity to seek assistance in a timely manner.</li>
                <li>Daily operations are designed around technology.</li>
                <li>The organization employs an open-access scheduling model so that 24-hour slots are always available for last-minute appointments.</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Challenges</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>There are challenges in implementing aspects of the ECHO model in TEACH BMT. For example, ECHO meetings do not seem beneficial to all staff members.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The leadership is enthusiastic and knowledgeable about program implementation and the ECHO model, the foundation of TEACH BMT.</li>
	                <li>Focus on program structure and quality improvement, including development of improvement models, is a strong asset of the organization’s leadership.</li>
	                <li>Key program staff are experienced with special populations.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The program is struggling with team-building using ECHO.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The program uses technology for provider engagement.</li>
	                <li>The program uses a fully integrated EHR called eCW to capture client encounters and enable sharing of information among providers from multidisciplinary teams.</li>
	                <li>Weekly didactic lectures via videoconference support case-based learning. Virtual face-to-face meetings allow providers to participate regardless of location.</li>
	                <li>Instant messaging is used to address immediate concerns regarding patient care and management.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Uptake of the patient portal has been poor across the agency, as the portal is not easily accessible.</li>
	                <li>There are struggles with team-building due to differing opinions on BMT.</li>
	                <li>The staff is grappling with provider availability and client management (i.e., maternity leave and vacations).</li>
	                <li>The new phone system directs client calls to all CHCI sites, thereby increasing unfamiliarity for the client and confusion for the staff. Clients are familiar with the reception staff at the sites they visit, and each site has a different process.</li>
	                <li>Some providers are resistant to using technology. They doubt that decreasing human interaction will add value.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Delaware and New Jersey behavioral health organizations are interested in in implementing ECHO BMT.</li>
	                <li>CHCI has a verbal agreement with many area organizations that have agreed to provide intensive outpatient services to clients who require higher levels of care than CHCI can provide.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	                <li>Social media (including Facebook and Twitter) is used to increase awareness of services and recruit potential clients.</li>
	                <li>The agency has a history of using proven outreach strategies that have been successful for other programs.</li>
	                <li>CHCI employs a tool called Language Line, which allows staff to quickly acquire a culturally competent translator in any language over the phone.</li>
	                <li>Marketing materials are printed in the top three languages for the target population.</li>
	                <li>Area substance abuse organizations that provide intensive outpatient services to clients are referral sources for CHCI.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The agency integrates primary and mental health services with opioid substitution therapy.</li>
	                <li>CHCI strives to provide quality care to individuals regardless of insurance status.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>

	                <li>The agency has staff available for developing and analyzing measures that can support strategies for sustainability.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There have been no approaches developed at this point that focus on sustainability.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>

	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There are challenges regarding consent forms from both patients and providers. Patients are not interested in signing consent forms, despite incentives.</li>

	                <li>Consider using mobile phones for services and supports beyond reminders.</li>
	                <li>Use technology as a physician extender and tool for outreach and engagement. Technology can help increase capacity, client contact, and engagement.</li>Along with technology, consider patient navigators as physician extenders.</li>
	                <li>Develop treatment protocols that employ technology, including tools that can be used to help clients track progress toward goals.</li>
	                <li>Consider using currently available technology (i.e., videoconferencing) for patient engagement and service delivery.</li>

	                <li>Consider obtaining client consent from group sessions.</li>
	                <li>Evaluation data should be useful in informing the agency and helping to make important decisions. For example, develop performance measures for each site to find success factors and workflows all sites can use.</li>
