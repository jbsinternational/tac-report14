<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The leadership values the importance of incorporating life skills into the recovery process.</li>
                <li>The agency targets the entire urban community and not only the AI/AN population.</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Challenges</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The community is home to a wide spectrum of individuals, from youth to elders.</li>
                <li>The team is only beginning to develop strategies for how to integrate technology into the delivery of services.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Leadership has realized the clinical and information technology (IT) departments should significantly increase their collaboration as technology use continues to permeate how the organization operates.</li>
	                <li>The project director’s interest in and experience with entrepreneurship will help support beneficial changes in nonprofit organizations such as NAHC.</li>
	                <li>The project director wants staff and department to share information and decrease silos. The project director believes increased communication among departments can help build the program more quickly.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There is a lack of interagency communication and coordination among departments, which can impede the project and organization as a whole.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The NextGen EHR is interoperable among the two major sites (San Francisco and Oakland).</li>
	                <li>The team is creating computer labs with refurbished computers and a wireless Internet connection. Clients will have open lab time to increase recovery support, and tutorial groups will be developed to enhance the effectiveness of the labs.</li>
	                <li>The EHR rolled out in March 2013. The upgrades are in line with meaningful use stage 2 and ICD-10 implementation.</li>
	                <li>The health information exchange will be available by August 2014; it will provide an exchange of information related to immunization records.</li>
	                <li>The portal contract will be signed by March 31, 2014, and a portal will be available by June 2014.</li>
	                <li>Telereminders are available for the dental department and in time will roll out to the iNative program.</li>
	                <li>Some of the substance abuse/mental health counselors are already using the NextGen EHR.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Although many clients have smartphones, there are still issues with access to technology and being able to use technology.</li>
	                <li>There is currently no telehealth application as most clients are close by; however, there are two satellite sites that could benefit from telehealth.</li>
	                <li>The no-show rate is at 20 percent, and no telereminder system is available except for the dental department.</li>
	                <li>There is a lack of integration of the various technologies and use across the organization to assist with delivery of services.</li>
	                <li>Buy-in from some clinical staff, particularly the licensed marriage and family therapy staff, could be improved.</li>
	                <li>Roadblocks in communication among staff and departments prevent information sharing, even when departments have common goals.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>NAHC has partnered with eight other clinics in the CHCN.</li>
	                <li>Partnerships are established with local, State, and Federal entities.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Partnerships with other Native American organizations have not always been successful.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Referrals come from onsite recovery groups and internal departments.</li>
	                <li>The CWD engages in much of the outreach, such as using engaged individuals to increase interest in others in the community.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Referrals have not been as frequent as hoped from other AI/AN organizations.</li>
	                <li>The Friendship House substance abuse program is not a strong resource because of the time clients stay in the program and because they often are from other States.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">

	                <li>The portal will be live by June 2014.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>ACA readiness for the agency has not been informed by a formal planning process.</li>
	                <li>No strategies have been developed for rollout of the portal.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The evaluation strategy has been developed. The analysis has given the team additional knowledge of the technology preferences of clients at NAHC.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The evaluation will benefit from being more dynamic and can include focus groups and quick-turnaround surveys to fully understand the targeted communities’ needs and interests.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>
