        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>WORC employs recovery coaches in recovery support.</li>
                <li>SACADA operates the PRC, which includes a clearinghouse, free substance abuse assessments for veterans, training, and State-mandated courses for individuals in the criminal justice system.</li>
                <li>SACADA draws on experience and lessons learned from other grant projects to help strengthen and address the needs of the WORC program.</li>
                <li>Community and board members meet with SACADA to determine if community needs related to recovery are met.</li>
                <li>SACADA sets up clients with gmail accounts so they can use the calendar share option to track public events.</li>

	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The executive director is working to ensure efforts contribute to the success and sustainability of the program.</li>
	                <li>The leadership team has a vision for extending the use of eROSC beyond Texas Human Service Region 8.</li>
	                <li>The leadership team views the current TAC-TCE grant as a building block for SACADA in extending care.</li>
	                <li>The board is involved and efforts to help provide funding for the agency.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Although leadership understands the significance of ACA, there is limited knowledge about its effects on the program and organization.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The program has developed and adapted various forms of recovery coach monitoring and documentation that help ensure quality services. The forms help the supervisor manage the coaches’ activities and their time. The supervisor is constantly available to assist the coaches.</li>
	                <li>Questionnaires are developed for the client to monitor each stage of recovery, such as the situational confidence questionnaire.</li>
	                <li>Recovery coaches are mostly bilingual (English and Spanish) because of the large Hispanic population in Bexar County and surrounding areas.</li>
	                <li>The WORC team members have all received GPRA training.</li>
	                <li>All the forms provided through the Web site have been translated to Spanish.</li>
	                <li>Web site training for clinicians, providers, recovery clients, and the general public are scheduled to begin in January 2014.</li>
	                <li>The leadership team has a good relationship with the Web site vendor (Medical Works Expert) and finds the company to be responsive to needs.</li>
	                <li>The program developed a contact information form after the GPRA training to ensure clients can be contacted for followup.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The design of the Web site does not engage a large population of users. It is too focused, and a Spanish version of the Web site should also be available.</li>
	                <li>It can be difficult to encourage people to sign up for insurance when they are focused on other basic needs (i.e., transportation, food).</li>
	                <li>Telehealth sessions consume data quickly and may be an issue related to clients’ willingness to use this service from their smartphones and tablets.</li>
	            </ul>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Recommended Enhancements</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Program Vision and Design</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Aside from sustaining recovery (recovery capital), it is important to engage clients further; for example, in life skills, employment, housing, and caring for children.</li>
	                <li>Employ telehealth where there are shorter, more frequent sessions.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Grantee Leadership</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Create a policy group composed of partner agencies to help track ongoing WORC tasks and projects to prioritize and help develop a workflow.</li>
	                <li>Stay current on ACA issues, and understand the stages of meaningful use and how they affect the organization and its programs.</li>
	                <li>Develop understanding of telehealth reimbursement because expansion in this area can help increase funding.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Implementation Plan</b></p>

	                <li>Develop a Spanish version of the Web site to fully capture the attention of the target population.</li>
	                <li>Develop the Web site to add value to all the target audiences, including current clients, community partners, and the general public seeking information. Different landing pages for the various types of users are a useful way to manage the site.</li>
	                <li>The public-facing part of the Web site should provide the public with resources and not be limited only to the registered clients. For example, add health care content and information on obstacles to recovery.</li>
	                <li>Ensure the Web portal is responsive to various technological devices and different browsers for improved access.</li>
	                <li>Increase engagement on the Web site using educational and informative videos. Videos can target the wide spectrum of users (providers, clients, general public).

	            <ul>
	                <li>Stay current on ACA and its effects.</li>
	                <li>Under ACA, quality reporting will be a factor. Consider designing the Web site so it can be a resource for providers to screen for substance abuse.</li>
	            </ul>

	            <ul>

	                <li>Stay current with ACA and the requirements of meaningful use.</li>
	                <li>Work with the IT department to develop policies that support a dynamic health information technology strategy.</li>

	        <p><b>Grantee Evaluation</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The Web site vendor should have analytics to help determine what aspects add value to the site.</li>
