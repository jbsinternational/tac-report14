<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>RCCCP connected with nearby cohort 1 TCE-TAC grantees (First Call and PFH) to incorporate their respective technologies as part of the CASE design.</li>
                <li>RCCCP staff underwent extensive training with First Call to learn about the CCMo EHR system and the protocols for completing client assessments and referrals.</li>
                <li>RCCCP plans to integrate existing record systems with the CCMo platform over time so that client services can be coordinated from a single repository.</li>
                <li>RCCCP has a long-term vision for incorporating technology in recovery services for clients.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The utility of the Homepsych platform is limited to completing psychological assessments. Clinicians also report the system uploads slowly.</li>
                <li>The intake process is time consuming. Clients are asked duplicate assessment questions, which prolongs entry into care and can make clients feel they are not trusted to answer questions honestly the first time.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>RCCCP leadership believes in the value of technology to support client outcomes.</li>
	                <li>Leadership is committed to partnering with organizations to expand the CASE program’s potential to deliver wraparound services.</li>
	                <li>Each year RCCCP staff undergo training on topics such as strategic planning, leadership development, HIPAA compliance, and cultural diversity issues.</li>
	                <li>CASE program staff appear strongly committed to achieving goals.</li>
	                <li>The program director uses the Ideas Exchange regularly to access resources and review discussion board posts. She also participates in biweekly grantee Webinars, podcasts, and other online activities to share news on emerging technologies with staff.</li>
	                <li>RCCCP is considering forming a consumer advisory council to help develop, assess, and promote programming that meets client needs.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>In the absence of a technology governance group, tasks associated with technology implementation are not prioritized, and effective implementation processes are threatened.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>RCCCP created a document of standard operating procedures that outlines the CASE program, the appropriate client consent forms, and step-by-step directions on how to use CCMo (complete with screen shots).</li>
	                <li>RCCCP has been mentored by fellow grantee First Call. The project manager and project director have made themselves readily available to assist with lessons learned and tips to ease implementation of the CCMo and Mobile CASE platforms. It has been beneficial to have a competent and responsive point of contact to troubleshoot issues.</li>
	                <li>The First Call team meets weekly to discuss technology enhancement opportunities for the platforms they support. First Call is willing to brainstorm new ideas, such as interfacing with different applications and interoperability potential.</li>RCCCP is committed to ensuring implementation fidelity across partner sites.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Managing workflow is RCCCP’s biggest challenge. As program participation expands, so will the need to restructure workflow. Without a formal workflow plan in place, staff run the risk of becoming overwhelmed.</li>
	                <li>The First Call contact person will be on extended leave for several months. During this time, RCCCP will need to establish another contact to manage questions and/or troubleshoot issues as they arise.</li>
	                <li>User questions may become bottlenecked if they go through multiple staff members. First Call said users may contact them directly to minimize the burden on the program director as a gatekeeper. This may not offer the most organized and efficient process.</li>
	                <li>The program director has been entering GPRA data into SAIS, which is not an efficient use of her time.</li>
	                <li>Changing established practices also means shifting attitudes and behaviors among clinical and administrative staff.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>RCCCP has a longstanding presence in the community and established partnerships with multiple Federal, State, and local agencies. Its reputation and voice in the community facilitate partnership opportunities.</li>
	                <li>RCCCP is focused on collaborating across agencies to more effectively and efficiently meet client needs. Partner agencies stand to benefit enormously from participating in this integrated approach to care.</li>
	                <li>Technology engagement will also increase peer engagement opportunities. RCCCP will grow demand for people to get involved as peer recovery support specialists.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>It can be challenging for partners to fully adopt a new service delivery system when they are emotionally attached to traditional methods. Some partners find it difficult to allow the clients to manage their own care.</li>
	                <li>The CASE program uses three forms of technology and is interacting with agencies that have their own platforms. It might be challenging to effectively integrate multiple technologies.</li>
	                <li>With a small staff, it is difficult to meet the training demand. RCCCP will need to identify strategies (including using technology and peer mentors) to support training needs.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Patients are empowered to take charge of their own care.</li>
	                <li>All client activities can be coordinated through a central portal.</li>
	                <li>Clients have commented on the value and utility of technology in supporting their treatment and recovery.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The online referral source can be challenging to use; however, the difficulty should dissipate with additional training and practice.</li>
	                <li>It can be challenging to manage multiple simultaneous referrals from multiple partner sites.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>RCCCP understands the value of distance treatment technology on client outcomes and appreciates the role technology will have in the future of patient care.</li>
	                <li>RCCCP staff are available to assist clients with navigating the health insurance marketplace.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Missouri is not a State slated for Medicaid expansion.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>While implementation has been their primary focus, staff are mindful of the importance of sustaining the project beyond the grant.</li>
	                <li>RCCCP has always considered sustainable practices as part of its program design. RCCCP developed an information technology strategic plan with the assistance of students from a local university to guide their approach to adopting new technologies.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>As the program grows, there will be increased demands on staff, which may affect their ability to manage competing program requirements.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Meeting GPRA reporting targets is a priority for CASE staff. GPRA training was recently completed, with a plan to repeat the training more broadly with other staff.</li>
	                <li>RCCCP is using data to capture the comprehensive service needs of clients. There are multiple data collection points RCCCP can use as a function of the CCMo platform.</li>
	                <li>RCCCP uses an objective, independent program evaluator to support data collection and assessment efforts.</li>
	                <li>RCCCP is motivated to build technology-related questions into the evaluation model to make the case for how technology-based practices enhance client outcomes.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Extreme winter weather in December, January, and February reduced the program’s ability to meet projected GPRA targets. Despite this setback, RCCCP anticipates exceeding targets moving forward.</li>
	                <li>The intake process is lengthy and includes redundant assessment questions.</li>
	                <li>Adjust workflow to accommodate collection of GPRA and other data.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>


	<h3 class="accordion-header">Recommended Enhancements</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Program Vision and Design</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Adapt the CASE program with the end user in mind. Consider the user experience to achieve the greatest potential and minimize frustration with technology use. Conduct routine focus groups to help guide decisionmaking regarding enhancements.</li>
	                <li>Consider having technology champions lead technology support groups and education efforts.</li>
	                <li>Consider expanding the online client portal content to include resources that benefit clients’ lives (information related to employment, dealing with emotions, housing, child welfare, etc.).</li>
	                <li>Conduct a crosswalk of Homepsych and CCMo functionalities, and consider consolidating the platforms so clients and clinicians use a single system.</li>
	                <li>Consider streamlining and automating assessment questions so clients can complete them on their own.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Grantee Leadership</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Form a governance group to help prioritize enhancements to increase the use of technology and to address barriers to service delivery.</li>
	                <li>Identify champions from within the organization and among clients to promote the value of using technology to enhance substance abuse treatment services.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Implementation Plan</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Minimize the steps needed to get things done to make the system much more accessible (i.e., effective and efficient) to clients and staff.</li>
	                <li>Develop efficient workflow policies and ensure staff are operating at the top end of their licenses.</li>
	                <li>Develop brief video-based tutorials and client testimonials to assist with training, implementation, and engagement efforts, particularly when in-person help is not available and/or travel is difficult. Videos can be housed online and accessed as needed.</li>
	                <li>Compile a document of frequently asked questions (to supplement the training manual) that can be uploaded directly to CCMo and Mobile CASE to troubleshoot common user issues.</li>
	                <li>Solicit client input at intake to better determine access to and preference for different types of technology. Clients suggested adding the following technology features:
	                	<ul>
	                		<li>Instant messenger capacity</li>
	                		<li>Real-time access to county-specific resources</li>
	                		<li>Panic button for trigger situations</li>
	                	</ul>
	                </li>
	                <li>Consider expanding content to include resources that benefit clients’ lives, such as information related to education, health care, employment, housing, and child welfare. Content must be relevant and easy to find.</li>
	                <li>Consider establishing a peer mentoring program where clients in recovery can support others with technology adoption and training. A similar process can be established for program staff. This is a professional development and confidence-building opportunity.</li>
	                <li>Establish a detailed project management plan to help set expectations for technology’s functionality, prioritize the adaptation and rollout of features, and identify a budget and timeline.</li>
	                <li>Determine which assessments tools are being used by clients, and make those a priority for what is automated on the CCMo system (after eliminating redundant questions).</li>
	                <li>Collaborate with First Call to develop a clear plan for receiving technical assistance while the point person is on leave.</li>
	                <li>Consider exploring telehealth opportunities as a way to connect clients with service providers.</li>
	                <li>Assign GPRA data entry tasks to administrative staff to relieve the program director of the responsibility so she can focus on program development priorities.</li>
	                <li>Solicit client input at intake to better determine access to and preference for different types of technology. JBS provided sample questionnaire language that can be incorporated in the client intake forms.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Collect qualitative and quantitative data to share with potential partners about the program’s value and effectiveness.</li>
	                <li>Create a detailed workplan to capture best practices for streamlining staff workflow and continuity of care strategies for clients who are transitioning to different service providers/agencies.</li>
	                <li>Develop a capacity-building strategy to effectively address needs while also considering limits on staff time and resources.</li>
	                <li>Leave prospective partners with something to review (e.g., a training video) immediately following an introductory session. When in-person visits are not possible, direct partners to an updated Web site or video link or hold a Webinar.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Explore technology-based options to encourage client engagement such as daily motivational text messages.</li>
	                <li>As an incentive to keep clients engaged, tap into agencies that can help acquire smartphones or tablets clients can use with discounted data plans. Outlets such as TechSoup provide free or low-cost resources.</li>
	                <li>Consider curtailing expansion activities until processes are in place to manage the current influx of clients or until expansion can happen without focusing on completing GPRA data collection with clients.</li>
	                <li>Address the shortage of licensed professionals by using telehealth to alleviate distance issues involved with recruiting providers. Consider connecting with universities to help recruit recent graduates who have provisional licenses.</li>
	                <li>Consider ways to streamline intake and consent processes. Have a single consent form that cuts across agencies so that if a client ends service in one location, he or she can continue to seek services elsewhere. Allowing clients to complete consent forms online may also be helpful.</li>
	                <li>Include links to other agencies on the Mobile CASE portal to empower clients to learn more.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Affordable Care Act Readiness</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Consider using the CASE program to demonstrate technology’s effectiveness in improving health outcomes for clients outside static clinical settings to help make the case for needed reimbursement reform.</li>
	                <li>Consider joining local chapters of health informatics groups to better understand how to use technology in the changing health care landscape.</li>
	                <li>Stay informed on ACA developments and demonstrate the value of early intervention and improved client engagement.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Sustainability Planning</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Sustainability planning should begin early and include a focus on workforce and financial strategies that can support the program beyond the life of the grant. Develop a strategic plan for the next several years with a focus on how the program will adapt to the technology requirements outlined under the ACA and HITECH Act.</li>
	                <li>Train recovery coaches to promote the program to embed CASE services in the community and reduce strain on staff. Expand credentialing opportunities for recovery coaches.</li>
	                <li>Demonstrate the value of technology to support broader RCCCP initiatives by showcasing the program’s cost-benefit and savings potential.</li>
	                <li>Build a robust Web presence to house training materials and other resources that clients and partners can access on a regular basis.</li>
	                <li>Develop a technology wish list that coincides with RCCCP’s expansion goals for the next 3–5 years.</li>
	                <li>Explore reimbursement options for providing clinical services (e.g., case management, counseling, telehealth services), including bundled treatment options.</li>
	                <li>Consider offering Mobile CCMo as a subscription service to partner agencies to defray maintenance costs.</li>
	                <li>Use the partner network to promote the adoption of favorable reimbursement policies.</li>

	        <p><b>Grantee Evaluation</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Collect evidence of program effectiveness to demonstrate why distance treatment services should be reimbursed in the future.</li>
	                <li>Streamline the intake assessment process by considering skip patterns or other strategies to reduce responding to unnecessary questions and eliminate redundancies in the questions asked.</li>
	                <li>Consolidate data elements and automate the questions on CCMo.</li>
	                <li>Assess client access to and preferences for using technology to help measure technology’s impact on client outcomes.</li>
