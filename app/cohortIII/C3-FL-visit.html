<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operation PAR has experience implementing a number of Federal grant awards and has generated lessons learned to support the successful implementation of the TAC program.</li>
                <li>The organization is mindful of exploring the evidence base and cost-effectiveness of strategies before they are implemented.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Potential clients may express interest in receiving technology-based services but are unable to do so because of misperceptions among referring entities (e.g., courts) about the effectiveness of such programming.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Operation PAR leadership believes in the value of technology to support client health outcomes, not just within the scope of this grant but for the organization more broadly.</li>
	                <li>The program team demonstrates passion, drive, and flexibility to achieve goals.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR staff have strong backgrounds in technology and behavioral health care and understand the needs of their target population. The leadership has been with the organization almost since the start and has a firm grasp on the programs that will benefit both clients and Operation PAR’s bottom line.</li>
	                <li>Members of Operation PAR leadership are well connected within the community and respected champions of client services. They have roles on many State and local advisory boards and have served as consultants on various Federal, State, and local initiatives.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Operation PAR has a longstanding history implementing federally-funded substance abuse programs and research initiatives on behalf of NIDA and CSAT.</li>
	                <li>Leadership remains flexible in its approach to implement new things and is willing to adapt existing practices to accommodate what works.</li>
	                <li>Creating a secure video component to the In the Rooms chat room heightens accountability and will make for a more engaging user experience.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Operation PAR is mindful of HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2 confidentiality considerations associated with using certain technologies, like mobile applications. Products undergo a rigorous review process before they are approved for client use.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Operation PAR understands the importance of identifying early adopters and champions to help move initiatives forward. It has already secured partners interested in advancing technology-based services.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR has a longstanding presence in the community and has established partnerships with multiple Federal, State, and local agencies. Its trusted reputation and voice in the community facilitate partnership opportunities.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR is collaborating with a fellow TAC grantee, The Centers, to maximize client service delivery potential.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Program staff have just recently begun to partner with the criminal justice system. Judges were apprehensive about allowing clients to receive technology-assisted counseling services. Operation PAR will need to build a strong evidence base to demonstrate the effectiveness of this modality on client outcomes.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Premier Community HealthCare has a dedicated staff member to coordinate referrals and communicate client status. While onsite at Premier, clients can use space set aside for them with a computer, microphone, camera, and Wi-Fi. </li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Staff are working to secure a relationship with judges to help clients remain compliant with court-ordered treatment plans. Judges have been reluctant to participate in the program; however, anecdotal and data-informed evidence may sway their opinions.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Operation PAR program staff are knowledgeable about the impact ACA will have on health care delivery systems. As one of the largest service providers in the State, Operation PAR is preparing to meet meaningful use requirements.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR understands the value of distance treatment technology on client outcomes and appreciates the role technology will have in the future of patient care. As a long-time user and supporter of technology, Operation PAR will continue to refine its processes to meet technology requirements.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR already has the data collection infrastructure in place—the dashboard—to identify and intervene with populations across its catchment area. The dashboard is a powerful information tool to inform client care.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR has an established electronic health record system through Netsmart.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Operation PAR is already one of the State’s largest Medicaid billers for substance abuse treatment services. Unfortunately, Florida did not support Medicaid expansion, which limits Operation PAR’s reimbursement opportunities.</li>
	                <li>Currently, the State only reimburses for in-person counseling services. Operation PAR is awaiting revisions to the State Medicaid manual to include reimbursement for distance counseling services.</li>
	                <li>Under new legislation, insurers could pay less for telehealth services.</li>
	                <li>Integrating a client portal through Netsmart’s electronic health record is cost-prohibitive at this time.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>While implementation has been their primary focus, staff are mindful of the importance of sustaining the project beyond the grant.</li>
	                <li>From the onset, Operation PAR has incorporated sustainable practices into its program design.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>As the program grows, there will be increased demand on staff, which may affect their ability meet program requirements.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Operation PAR has developed a comprehensive reporting mechanism, referred to as a data dashboard. The tool links client information from the electronic health record to generate sophisticated reports about program outcomes and other performance metrics.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR has established the infrastructure to support data collection and reporting procedures. Staff are familiar with using the GPRA reporting tool.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR offers incentives to clients to encourage continued program participation and the completion of followup reporting requirements.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR staff are motivated to build technology-related questions into their evaluation model to make the case for how technology-based practices enhance client outcomes. This will be an asset for future sustainability efforts.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR has trackers in place to measure how clients are using different forms of technology. These monitoring tools will inform product effectiveness and utility and will help determine long-term investment decisions.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Operation PAR does not yet have evaluation results to draw from.</li>
	                <li>Program workflow may need to be adjusted to accommodate the collection of GPRA and GAIN data.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>


	<h3 class="accordion-header">Recommended Enhancements</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Program Vision and Design</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Anecdotes and data-driven results will be important to establish further credibility with judges.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Grantee Leadership</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Continue to identify champions within Operation PAR, across partner organizations, and among clients to promote the value of using technology to enhance substance abuse treatment services.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Implementation Plan</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Developing a Web presence with public and private-facing resources will benefit clients when they are not being seen by their provider. Include resources that affect clients’ lives, such as information related to child care, employment, dealing with emotions, scheduling, and staying organized. Content must be applicable and easy to find.</li>
	                <li>There are many recovery-centered resources that clients can access. Consider asking clients for recommendations on the mobile applications and motivational podcasts that will benefit them the most.</li>
	                <li>Consider building a library of online resources. The more robust and searchable, the higher the value.</li>
	                <li>Social media platforms like Facebook are popular ways to promote program activities. Consider using these tools to announce special events and other outreach opportunities.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR may wish to consider developing a “newcomers” guide to introduce clients to the program. It could include video testimonials from clients who have benefitted from using Operation PAR services.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>A detailed work plan may help capture best practices for streamlining staff work flow and continuity of care strategies for clients who are transitioning to different service providers/agencies.</li>
	                <li>Continue to collect qualitative and quantitative data to share with potential partners about the program’s value and effectiveness.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Operation PAR may wish to use technology as an outreach and engagement tool, in addition to encouraging client retention. Diversified forms of technology can benefit clients even before they are formally enrolled in services.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR may wish to adjust its workflow to enhance engagement strategies.</li>The program may benefit from identifying clients who have had success in their own recovery to serve as champions to others.</li>
	                <li>Texting may serve as an effective marketing mechanism to spread the word about Operation PAR and to complement other outreach activities. Consider incorporating “thought-of-the-day” or other motivational messages as part of engagement and retention strategies.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Affordable Care Act Readiness</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Technology will serve as the currency of health reform. Consider using the Operation PAR program as a way to demonstrate technology’s effectiveness in improving health outcomes for clients outside static clinical settings. This may help to make the case for needed reimbursement reform.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Sustainability Planning</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Sustainability planning should begin early and include a focus on workforce and financial strategies that can support the program beyond the life of the grant. Develop a strategic plan for the next several years with a focus on how the program will adapt to the technology requirements outlined under the ACA.</li>
	                <li>Training recovery coaches to promote the program will help to embed the program into the community and reduce strain on staff.</li>
	                <li>Demonstrate the value of technology in supporting broader Operation PAR initiatives by showcasing the program’s cost-benefit and savings potential.</li>
	                <li>Develop efficient work policies and ensure that staff are operating at the top end of their licenses.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Grantee Evaluation</b></p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>It may be beneficial to consider collecting additional data beyond what is required by GPRA. Include questions that capture clients’ use of and satisfaction with technology.</li>
	                <li>Operation PAR may wish to streamline data collection strategies to ease respondent fatigue. Organizing the progression of questions, using skip patterns, and linking responses to tailored resources may increase completion rates.</li>
	                <li>Outcomes data are essential to diversify funding. Collect evidence of program effectiveness to demonstrate why distance treatment services should be funded in the future.</li>
	            </ul>
