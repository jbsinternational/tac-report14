	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The organization has established a cross-functional implementation and advisory committee.</li>
	                <li>A stable leadership team is emerging after the organization’s significant employee turnover.</li>
	                <li>The leadership believes the EHR implementation benefits the organization as a whole and not simply a program within Irene Stacy.</li>
	                <li>The leadership is working diligently to rebuild staff after many staff left during the organizational overhaul.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>A completely new team has been established with no member of the original grant committee present.</li>
	                <li>The leadership has little understanding of the Affordable Care Act and the implications for Irene Stacy.</li>
	                <li>The leadership has no established connections with the State policymakers involved with health reform and health information technology efforts.</li>
	                <li>The commitment of clinical and executive leadership in EHR implementation and contract management will be greater than is currently anticipated by staff.</li>
	                <li>It is necessary to envision this project as more than a technology project with regard to resources needed.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The organization is focused on the EHR benefitting the entire organization even though the grant is focused on the drug and alcohol program.</li>
	                <li>Irene Stacy is open to telehealth and has contracted with another agency for telepsychiatry.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There will be a significant challenge in managing the contractor and ensuring Anasazi is responsive in providing needed training and support.</li>
	                <li>Barriers to EHR use include employees who may be resistant to the changes necessitated by introducing technology into the workflow and employees with little computer knowledge.</li>
	                <li>There is no EHR clinical staff peer support in-house for staff to use Anasazi since few people understand how to use the software.</li>
	                <li>There is no wireless capability at Irene Stacy.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Irene Stacy has contracted with and colocated within the local Veterans Affairs facility in Butler for two beds to be available for community-based crisis stabilization.</li>
	                <li>The new executive director has met with individuals at the State to become more actively involved in statewide behavioral health issues.</li>
	                <li>There are community programs such as MobileMeds, Assertive Community Treatment, blended case management, and family-based programs that work closely with sister agencies.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The leadership could benefit from more sustained connections with the appropriate State agencies and community organizations about policymaking and decisions being made regarding health information technology and the Affordable Care Act.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">

	            <ul>
	                <li>The local hospital routinely refers patients to Irene Stacy.</li>
	                <li>The staff are working on marketing efforts such as electronic billboards and redesigning program services brochures, including employing quick response codes so people can easily access the Web site and services.</li>
	                <li>Irene Stacy is working on coordinating with other agencies that do not offer the services offered by Irene Stacy.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There are no active marketing efforts in place now; brochures need to be updated.</li>
	                <li>The Web site is static and does not provide useable information to potential clients about center programs and how to gain access to them.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Current Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and confidentiality policies are in place.</li>
	            </ul>
