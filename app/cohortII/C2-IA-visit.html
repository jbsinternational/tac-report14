<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>IDPH is the only State-level grant recipient in the TAC portfolio.</li>
                <li>IDPH’s substance abuse treatment program is modeled after an established system of care for clients with gambling issues.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Among rural populations, there is a general lack of understanding about treatment. Specific groups (e.g., drug-using parents, cultural minorities, new immigrants, non-English speakers, Native Americans) may be fearful of participating in government services.</li>
                <li>It can be challenging to engage and retain clients in treatment beyond initial contact. Clients tend to remain engaged in treatment services if they access treatment within 2 days of receiving a referral. About half of IDPH clients engaged in intensive outpatient services complete their treatment plans; 57.6 percent of clients will experience a relapse.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>IRHIT is embedded within IDPH’s Bureau of Substance Abuse and has the support of the division’s director.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Partner agencies do not yet have technology champions at each of the active sites.</li>
	                <li>The project team’s time is spread across several projects; therefore, maintaining a consistent focus will become more challenging, especially as IRHIT expands to other provider agencies and client enrollment increases.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Provider agencies offer traditional services and an assortment of distance treatment services to their clients.</li>
	                <li>IRHIT staff have an active role in facilitating provider education on how to use the Recoveration.org portal.</li>
	                <li>IRHIT staff have remained flexible in their implementation strategy and are willing to adapt delivery mechanisms as needed.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Integration of technology is influenced by staff workflow within provider agencies. Adoption of new policies and procedures must be mindful of the site’s culture and approach toward providing recovery services to clients. In some cases, this has required incorporating technology more slowly than anticipated.</li>
	                <li>Providers that prefer traditional face-to-face client encounters are less inclined to incorporate technology into their practice. Implementation, then, will require additional time to overcome general reluctance.</li>
	                <li>Many providers are concerned that telehealth options infringe on patient confidentiality, even though these technologies are in wide use nationwide.</li>
	                <li>Clients may demonstrate some reluctance in managing Web-based aspects of the treatment process on their own. A lack of Web experience coupled with concerns about confidentiality and a lack of provider explanation of the value could inhibit use.</li>
	                <li>Geographically, broadband service is unreliable in many rural communities.</li>
	                <li>Communications and resources must be adapted to take into consideration clients’ language, literacy, and education levels.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>IDPH is part of an extensive network of policymakers, health care providers, businesses, and other stakeholders committed to protecting Iowa’s health needs. This can leverage IRHIT’s ability to bring potential partners to the table. </li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Staffing limitations strain IRHIT’s ability to effectively expand the project.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The Recoveration.org portal is featured on ISAIC—a comprehensive online behavioral health information and referral site.</li>
	                <li>Providers may also take advantage of the State’s health information network—IHIN.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Identifying program champions/mentors from among agency staff and clients has been challenging.</li>
	                <li>ISAIC and Recoveration.org do not reference themselves on each other’s sites.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>IDPH has established relationships with provider organizations and can foster these connections to work toward integrating mental health and substance abuse services.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>IDPH needs to develop a proactive, data-informed strategy at the State level to bring together the State’s mental health and substance abuse services.</li>
	                <li>Existing payment structures do not provide incentives for using technology. Current provider reimbursement schedules are based on the number of clients staff see (i.e., billable activities), and using technology takes away from billable hours. Payment schedules will radically shift under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which will focus on reimbursement for patient outcomes, more so than individual service events.</li>
	                <li>Provider agencies are at different stages of implementing electronic health record systems. Some have not implemented a system into their practice.</li>
	                <li>IDPH cannot afford to modify its WITS application to comply with ACA standards.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>IDPH understands the value of distance treatment technology on client outcomes and appreciates the role technology will have on the future of patient care. While implementation has been the primary focus, staff are mindful of the importance of sustaining IRHIT beyond the grant. </li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>IRHIT staff responsible for managing the project have other responsibilities within IDPH. As the program grows, this will increase demand on staff and reduce their ability to effectively serve geographically diverse sites.</li>
	                <li>IRHIT services are not reimbursed under current billing schedules. Payment is reserved for in-person sessions.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The IRHIT evaluator has extensive experience conducting evaluations at the State level.</li>
	                <li>IRHIT is committed to exploring technology’s impact on health outcomes.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Because of State budget cuts, IDPH lost its original data-entry person. The program evaluator is now managing this responsibility, which is not an effective use of his time. As the program expands, this task will become too time consuming to manage and not an appropriate function for the epidemiologist to perform.</li>
	                <li>Staff have set a high GPRA intake goal—1,970 clients (as originally identified in their application).</li>
	                <li>Agencies are reluctant to share information about how the Recoveration.org site is used by clients and counselors. A lack of access to site analytics creates a missed opportunity to inform evaluation efforts.</li>
	                <li>Client data have become siloed across systems.</li>
	                <li>Behavioral health providers have not been active users of the IHIN system.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>
