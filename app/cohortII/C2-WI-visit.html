<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The staff are respectful of elders and seek their guidance regarding community events. AODA counselors ask the elders for approval and feedback when planning events.</li>
                <li>Events are held according to the season, so individuals are more likely to participate. There is storytelling in the winter and medicine searching in the summer.</li>
                <li>Peer recovery is in place, with community members in recovery engaging others.</li>
                <li>Smaller group sessions help clients be more open.</li>
                <li>FCP HWC employs telehealth; the physician is at her home location and FCP does the intake.</li>
                <li>Most staff are well connected at work with computers, laptops, and cell phones.</li>
                <li>The program provides health assessments and will consider using tablets to collect information when the technology has been approved and implemented.</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Challenges</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>There is only one telehealth room available.</li>
                <li>The AODA counselors find the assessments lengthy and repetitive.</li>
            </ul>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The leadership believes telehealth is critical to serving underserved populations.</li>
	                <li>The team works together to overcome challenges that arise, including internal issues and those with clients.</li>
	                <li>The executive team believes in the value of using technology and has an IT vision, which was not in place earlier for FCP.</li>
	                <li>A technology steering committee has been created to help FCP progress with technological needs.</li>
	                <li>The IT department has a Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance manager.</li>
	            </ul>

	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>

	            <ul>
	                <li>Most of the tribal members have mobile phones and access to the Internet which helps when using technology in the program.</li>
	                <li>The executive team has narrowed the electronic health record (HER) search to two candidates and hopes to implement one by 2014.</li>
	                <li>FCP uses SharePoint which allows all employees access to information.</li>
	                <li>The program hopes to employ a behavioral health representative within the care team of Certified Medical Assistants.</li>

	            </ul>

	                <li>Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) questions have been compromised when they were asked incorrectly.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There is limited understanding of the SBIRT model.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">

	                <li>The Web site is not set up to act like a portal, which is an important tool to help increase recruitment and engagement. </li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>

	            <ul>

	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">

	            <ul>
	                <li>FCP seeks other revenue options apart from those available from tribally owned casinos to maintain the organization’s health care service system.</li>
	                <li>Because of the limited availability of individuals in the area who might access substance abuse treatment, FCP seeks to expand into Milwaukee and surrounding areas using telehealth.</li>
	                <li>FCP has much land for physical expansion, such as new buildings; however, using telehealth would help make the building capacity more efficient.</li>
	                <li>FCP is considering increasing its focus on wellness and using primary care providers to promote this service delivery philosophy.</li>
	            </ul>

	                <li>The grant evaluation is limited and does not use information necessary for FCP to understand the scope of its potential target populations and use of technology in providing and supporting client care.</li>
