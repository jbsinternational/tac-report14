	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>BVI’s leadership is not afraid of change and progress and often seeks alternative ways to promote client recovery; for example, assisting in housing initiatives for individuals who are homeless and in recovery.</li>
	                <li>Team members collaborate to achieve the organization’s goals.</li>
	                <li>The leadership is committed to providing services to the community.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Workforce-related issues are affecting program expansion, including staff unwilling to work nontraditional office hours, staff resistance to technology that is crucial to the expansion of the organization, and counselors not able to provide recovery assistance in a way that aligns with new processes.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>BVI has its own management information system.</li>
	                <li>The Web site has program applications and assessment tools available to clients seeking BVI services.</li>
	                <li>Because of its rural location, BVI uses telehealth to deliver clinical services.</li>
	                <li>BVI uses a range of technologies to enhance service delivery, including an EHR, instructional videos through OmniJoin, and an application called SecureHealth.</li>
	                <li>BVI staff are beta testing mobile applications (e.g., Step Away) for smartphones, and a mobile application for SecureHealth is in progress.</li>
	                <li>BVI uses an electronic health record (EHR) system called Sequest; the last set of trainings for the system is being scheduled.</li>
	                <li>Technology assists BVI in reaching clients and site managers, facilitating communication throughout its large service delivery area.</li>
	                <li>BVI provides e-treatment, which increases the likelihood of return treatment and engagement, particularly for those individuals in rural locations or those without access to reliable transportation.</li>
	                <li>A resource center is available for supplemental recovery support where clients can access resources such as job listings, obtain community support, and view videos.</li>
	                <li>There are currently two peer specialists who have completed the certification; BVI plans to increase the use of the peer specialist approach.</li>
	                <li>BVI is able to receive reimbursement for the provision of peer support services.</li>
	                <li>The Webcam has good audio and visual quality, which is essential for patient engagement.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Existing workflows do not always support effective and efficient service delivery.</li>
	                <li>There are training and supervision issues, including clinicians who are uncomfortable with technology, staff who need to learn how to engage clients more effectively, and staff unwilling to work nontraditional hours.</li>
	                <li>The three hour-long intensive outpatient sessions conducted via teleconference are too long and do not effectively engage patients.</li>
	                <li>BVI provides services to sprawling rural areas, and the efforts to expand technology to reach these areas have resulted in staff development issues. Staff training is needed to address the work schedule issue, and changes in workflow will help accommodate the program’s expansion.</li>
	                <li>Fewer than expected numbers of clients had smartphones and computer access; therefore, there was less use of e-continuing care services than anticipated.</li>
	                <li>There are challenges with phone and computer connectivity in remote locations, causing difficulty in staff use of TIERS.</li>
	                <li>While the Webcam quality is good, the angle and view could be improved.</li>
	            </ul>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">

	                <li>Debbie Hillin has been president of the Tennessee Association of Alcohol, Drug and other Addiction Services.</li>
	                <li>Buffalo Valley is able to purchase an information system, while smaller organizations are unable to do so. As a result, they have developed a consortium for smaller organizations to share the same system at a nominal cost.</li>
	                <li>Buffalo Valley has programs serving individuals who are homeless, veterans, and other underserved populations, including those in jail.</li>
	                <li>Buffalo Valley partners with the University of Alaska (developers for Step Away mobile application).</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Affiliation decisions have been difficult since not all programs want to partner in a consortium.</li>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Buffalo Valley’s consortium for an EHR can benefit the State and support increased connectivity of organizations with one another and with health information exchanges.</li>
	                <li>The SecureHealth application on the Web site is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Health Level Seven.</li>
	                <li>Sequest’s TIER solution is 2011–2012 compliant and certified as a complete EHR by the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>BVI is working toward reaching the target Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) intake by year’s end.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Buffalo Valley’s expansion will require more planning to accommodate increased intakes.</li>
	                <li>Consider becoming a health home to improve comprehensive health care and active partnerships.</li>

	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>

	                <li>Buffalo Valley is not sure at what point a client is part of a discharge GPRA or 6-month GPRA data collection activity.</li>
