    <h2 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many grantees have invested in technologies that support efficient and coordinated clinical service delivery for clients, such as Web-based client portals, text messaging, videoconferencing, and mobile applications.</li>

            <li>The use of Web-based client portals and electronic health records helps participating agencies manage client needs more effectively and increase collaboration around treatment plans.</li>

            <li>Many programs offer client-centered care to engage and retain clients in recovery services.</li>

            <li>Technology enables clients to connect to recovery support services (such as discussion boards) anonymously and at times that work best for them.</li>

            <li>Integrated electronic health records will enhance the ability of program staff to bill third-party vendors, collect patient demographics, schedule client appointments, and access data for evaluation purposes.</li>

            <li>Technology is increasingly more accessible to clients and available in a variety of platforms. Some program staff have seen an increased uptake in technology use among younger clients</li>

            <li>Technology makes it possible to reach clients, partnering agencies, and other stakeholders in ways that were once only possible by traveling long distances. This benefit allows for more frequent communication and increased visibility to foster engagement and participation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Some program staff have concerns about ensuring patient confidentiality and the cost of using certain technologies.</li>

            <li>Integration of electronic health records is complicated when multiple platforms in use are not compatible with one another. In some cases, information is not transferrable across systems. Other challenges include accessibility of client data and certification of electronic health record systems.</li>

            <li>Client use of technology can be inhibited by four factors: (1) cost (many live below the Federal poverty level), (2) inconsistent living arrangements, (3) unreliable access to technology (particularly smartphones with data plans), and (4) lack of support from family or peers who might also be dealing with substance abuse or co-occurring disorders.</li>

            <li>Among rural populations, there can be a lack of understanding about mental health and substance use treatment. Specific groups (such as mentally ill and/or drug-using parents, cultural minorities, new immigrants, non-English speakers, and Native Americans) may be fearful of participating in government services.</li>
            <li>Long-term client engagement and retention in treatment can be challenging. Program staff must effectively demonstrate the technology’s value to clients to encourage staying in care.</li>


        </ul>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Technology enables leadership and program staff to collaborate effectively to advance organizational goals.</li>
            <li>When leadership staff believe in technology’s ability to enhance client outcomes, they can see the benefits to the organization as a whole.</li>
            <li>People in leadership roles often have backgrounds in behavioral health care and understand the needs of their clients in ways that support program development efforts.</li>
            <li>When people in leadership roles are well connected in their communities, they can leverage those connections to facilitate external support for program expansion.</li>
            <li>People in leadership roles in the programs are often passionate, dedicated, and forward thinking.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Partner agencies sometimes do not have technology champions at each active site. In many cases, administrators are reluctant to use technology for fear of disturbing workflow practices and concerns over client confidentiality.</li>
            <li>Individuals in leadership roles may have limited understanding of the implications for integrating technology into practice as outlined by the Affordable Care Act.</li>
            <li>Some program staff may view the use of technology as the purview of the IT department rather than as a clinical tool and a means to improve quality care and continuity of services.</li>


        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Implementation</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provider agencies offer traditional services and an assortment of distance treatment modalities to enhance client recovery efforts. For example, they use electronic health records, client portals, Web sites, email, smartphone applications, text messaging, and videoconferencing.</li>
            <li>Telehealth enables clients to access technology in a variety of ways from their personal computers, smartphones, and tablets.</li>
            <li>In general, program staff have remained flexible in their implementation strategy and are willing to adapt delivery mechanisms as needed.</li>
            <li>In some cases, additional social media strategies have been implemented to further expand outreach potential.</li>
            <li>Technology can be used to support broader life skill development in areas such as employment, dealing with emotions, child welfare, and housing.</li>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees may have limited staff resources to fully implement programs and manage expansion efforts. Some programs may not be able to support growth.</li>
            <li>Staff time may be spread across several programs; therefore, maintaining a consistent focus is challenging, especially as programs expand and client enrollment increases.</li>
            <li>Some technologies are less convenient to use, partly because of unreliable Internet connections in many rural areas. Other technologies are not as user friendly as anticipated. Clients can be less inclined to troubleshoot issues or remain engaged when technology does not perform as expected.</li>
            <li>Integration of technology is influenced by staff workflow within provider agencies. Adoption of new policies and procedures must be consistent with the site’s culture and approach toward providing recovery services to clients. In some cases, this has meant incorporating technology more slowly than anticipated.</li>
            <li>Providers who prefer traditional face-to-face client encounters can be less inclined to incorporate technology into their practice. Such reluctance can delay implementation.</li>
            <li>Many providers are concerned that telehealth options infringe on patient confidentiality, even though the technologies are in wide use nationwide.</li>
            <li>Clients may demonstrate some reluctance managing Web-based aspects of the treatment process on their own. A lack of Web experience, concerns about confidentiality, and a dearth of provider champions could inhibit use.</li>
            <li>Integrating technology such as electronic health records into provider practices requires sufficient training and technical assistance support from system vendors. Time, resources, and willingness to troubleshoot technical issues are often limited in busy practice settings.</li>
            <li>A high rate of staff turnover at partner agencies can hinder the ability to institutionalize new practices. Much time is required to train new staff and refine workflow.</li>
            <li>Some partner agencies have opted not to participate in a program, creating a significant setback to achieving implementation goals.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A program’s leadership and staff can have strong ties to the communities where they operate. Many have active boards with established relationships with key stakeholders.</li>
            <li>Many programs are actively partnering with community agencies to expand client services.</li>
            <li>Many programs are working to diversify their workforce and streamline processes for those who wish to deliver treatment and recovery-oriented services to clients.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A high rate of staff turnover at partner agencies can make it difficult to recruit and retain excellent health care providers whose support can help institutionalize a program beyond the grant’s life.</li>
            <li>In some cases, linkages with other organizations could be further explored and strengthened.</li>
            <li>Several sites that were initially approached to participate in the program determined they did not have the clients or the interest in incorporating technology into their recovery curriculum.</li>
            <li>Program implementation can be taxed by geographical distance between sites. Technology is essential to effectively manage the program among participating agencies.</li>
            <li>In some cases, leadership may benefit from more sustained connections with the appropriate State agencies and community organizations regarding policymaking and decisionmaking related to health information technology and the Affordable Care Act.
            </li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many programs are actively recruiting new community partners to increase client referral opportunities. Targeted outreach to individuals and organizations in a variety of different settings—court systems, health clinics, military installations, behavioral health centers, and schools, to name a few—will help expand service potential.</li>
            <li>In many cases, program staff are using a variety of marketing strategies—such as radio, print, and television announcements—to promote their activities. They are also escalating online marketing capacity by using social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn to reach clients and raise community awareness.</li>
            <li>Many programs have effectively used Web sites and developed tools such as videos and Webinars to create an accessible and convenient user experience for staff and clients.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some programs are unable to support expansion efforts because of workflow limitations or provider reluctance to incorporate technology into their practice settings.</li>
            <li>A high rate of staff turnover at partner agencies can contribute to recruitment and retention challenges.</li>
            <li>Identifying program champions and mentors among agency staff has been difficult. Candidates often do not know enough about the technology to see the value of using it with their clients.</li>
            <li>Several programs do not have a marketing plan in place. An effective plan should outline client outreach strategies, suggest relationship-building opportunities, and include a multiplatform approach to target stakeholders, using both traditional and electronic marketing mediums.
            </li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many programs are well positioned to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).</li>
            <li>Often individuals in leadership roles are engaged in State and local policy development activities to prepare for agency-wide changes.</li>
            <li>Some programs have established partnerships with primary care providers and are actively working to integrate their systems to support continuity of care for clients.</li>
            <li>Several programs are using electronic health records (EHRs) that have been certified by the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology.</li>
            <li>Many programs are actively planning to achieve Stage 2 Meaningful Use goals.</li>
            <li>Many grantees are strongly committed to using health information technology and other strategies to enhance technology-assisted care.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provider agencies are at different stages of implementing EHR systems. Some have not implemented a system in their practice, while others are using different systems that are not compatible with one another. This can hinder communications and limit the ability to provide the best possible support for patients.</li>
            <li>Modifying existing EHRs to comply with ACA requirements can be cost prohibitive.</li>
            <li>Payment structures may not provide incentives for using technology. Current provider reimbursement schedules are based on the number of clients staff see (i.e., billable activities), and using technology takes away from billable hours. Payment schedules will radically shift under ACA, which will focus on reimbursement for patient outcomes, not individual service events.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Sustainability</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many programs understand the value of distance treatment technology related to client outcomes and appreciate the role technology will have on the future of patient care. While implementation has been the primary focus, staff are generally mindful of the importance of sustaining technology beyond the grant’s life.</li>
            <li>Using technology is a means to make capacity-building efforts more efficient. Dollars typically set aside for building development can be diverted to expand technology to a wider target population.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Third-party billing systems (Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance) are important drivers of program sustainability. Many programs do not have payment structures in place to reimburse for the use of technology.</li>
            <li>Some programs lack a robust sustainability plan that addresses program design, workflow, and reimbursement, among other critical components. Integrating care across systems and engaging in health information exchanges will be essential to program survival.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Evaluation</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some evaluation and data collection efforts are much more inclusive than what is required to meet Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requirements. Programs have incorporated existing instruments or designed their own to assess technology’s role in enhancing client outcomes.</li>
            <li>Using gift cards and other incentives are effective strategies to boost client GPRA followup rates.</li>
            <li>Extracting data from client portals and using tracking analytics enhance the ability to measure the effectiveness of service delivery mechanisms.</li>
            <li>A comprehensive program evaluation plan and dedicated evaluation staff are necessary to produce robust findings.</li>
            <li>System interoperability expands data collection opportunities.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Obtaining followup data from transient or precariously housed individuals can be difficult. Programs are encouraged to acquire multiple points of contact.</li>
            <li>GPRA data do not directly measure the effects of technology on client outcomes. Programs must use other assessment tools to determine the extent to which technology is making a difference.</li>
            <li>Data collection is time consuming and labor intensive. Partner agencies are reluctant to divert staff resources toward this effort, particularly because of workforce and budget constraints.</li>
            <li>Client data can become isolated when it is not possible to communicate across EHR systems. A lack of access to site analytics represents a missed opportunity to inform evaluation efforts.

                <li>Program leaders support cross-functional operations and believe implementation should involve collaboration across all involved departments.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Although program leaders understand the general significance of the Affordable Care Act, there is limited knowledge about its potential effects on the program and organization.</li>
                <li>In the absence of a technology governance group, tasks associated with technology implementation are not prioritized and effective implementation processes are threatened.</li>
                <li>There is a lack of interagency communication and coordination among departments, which can impede the project and organization as a whole.</li>
                <li>Program leaders often have responsibilities beyond their immediate roles, which reduces their ability to focus on project-specific tasks.</li>

                <li>Technology can be used to support broader life skill development around topics such as employment, dealing with emotions, child welfare, or housing.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some organizations may have multiple telehealth and data platforms operating concurrently. There is a need to consolidate technologies without sacrificing performance or functionality.</li>
                <li>Buy-in is essential to program success. Some staff and clients may feel uncertain about the security and privacy of patient health information when using technology platforms. A lack of technology experience coupled with a dearth of provider champions could inhibit implementation progress.</li>
                <li>Technology dramatically affects workflow during the early implementation phase, which can lead to a decline in productivity and staff acceptance. As program participation expands, so will the need to restructure workflow. Without a formal workflow plan in place, staff run the risk of becoming overwhelmed. Changing established practices also means shifting attitudes and behaviors of clinical and administrative staff.</li>
                <li>Roadblocks in communication among staff and departments prevent information sharing, even when departments have common goals.</li>
                <li>Coordinating and prioritizing next steps for implementation will require a detailed project management plan guided by a user group and governance group.</li>
                <li>It has been challenging to implement new technology when there are issues related to general access, Internet connectivity, cell reception, firewall restrictions, and outdated equipment. Clients are less inclined to troubleshoot issues or remain engaged when technology does not perform as expected.</li>
                <li>Providers that prefer traditional face-to-face client encounters are less inclined to incorporate technology in their practice; implementation will require additional time and education to overcome reluctance. Adoption of new policies and procedures must be consistent with the site’s culture and approach toward providing recovery services to clients. In some cases, this reality has required incorporating technology more slowly than anticipated.</li>
                <li>Reimbursement challenges inhibit technology adoption. Few State Medicaid offices have behavioral health specialists and advocates to influence policy and reimbursement considerations.</li>

                <li>Program staff are using a variety of marketing strategies to promote their activities. They are also escalating online marketing capacity by using social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn to reach clients and raise community awareness.</li>
                <li>Continued exposure in the community will encourage targeted groups to seek program services and help generate favorable word-of-mouth marketing campaigns.</li>
                <li>Many organizations have an extensive network of partners and referrals for identifying and engaging clients in service.</li>
                <li>Clients have commented on the value and utility of technology in supporting their treatment and recovery.</li>
                <li>Project staff are actively recruiting new community partners to increase client referral opportunities. Targeted outreach to individuals and organizations in a variety of different settings—court systems, health clinics, military installations, behavioral health centers, and schools, to name a few—will help expand service potential.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It can be challenging to manage simultaneous referrals from multiple partner sites.</li>
                <li>It may take time for some clients to feel comfortable transitioning from more traditional recovery modalities. Understanding client preferences for and access to different technologies will assist in outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts.</li>
                <li>Some clients may not have consistent phone numbers, data plans, or email addresses that would facilitate receiving information and/or accessing technology-based services.</li>
                <li>Some programs are unable to support expansion efforts because of workflow limitations or provider reluctance to incorporate technology in their practice settings.</li>
                <li>Staff turnover at partner agencies makes it difficult to recruit and retain high-quality health care providers whose support can help institutionalize the program beyond the grant’s life.</li>
                <li>It has been difficult to identify program champions and mentors among agency staff. Potential candidates often do not know enough about the technology to see the value of using it with their clients.</li>
                <li>Several programs do not have a marketing plan in place. An effective plan should outline client outreach strategies, suggest relationship-building opportunities, and include a multiplatform approach to target stakeholders, using both traditional and electronic marketing mediums.</li>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The organizations understand the value of distance treatment technology on client outcomes and appreciate the role technology will have in the future of patient care. They are strongly committed to using health information technology and other strategies to enhance technology-assisted care.</li>
                <li>Those in leadership roles generally understand the importance of preparing for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and some are involved in policy development activities at the Federal, State, and local levels.</li>
                <li>Most organizations are knowledgeable about the effects ACA will have on health care delivery systems and are actively preparing to meet meaningful use requirements. These sites, for example, have established electronic health record systems that are (or are in the process of becoming) certified for stage 2 meaningful use.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>ACA readiness in many locations has not been informed by a formal planning process. Organizations may benefit from a dedicated strategic plan to help recognize opportunities and challenges related to ACA implementation.</li>
                <li>Reimbursement challenges affect overall program success. Few State Medicaid offices have behavioral health specialists and advocates to influence policy and reimbursement considerations. Several organizations are based in non-Medicaid expansion States. There are also some States that have elected not to implement a health information exchange. As a result, there may be limited affordable health insurance coverage opportunities available to clients.</li>
                <li>Provider agencies are at different stages of implementing electronic health record systems. Some have not implemented a system into their practice, while others are using different platforms that are not compatible with each other. This inhibits agencies from communicating effectively with one another and providing the best possible support for patient outcomes.</li>
                <li>Organizations are concerned about protecting client privacy. Considerations related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act have delayed program implementation in some locations.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>SSuccess Factors:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Several organizations have considered sustainable practices as part of their program design. They understand the value of distance treatment technology related to client outcomes and appreciate the role technology will have on the future of patient care. While implementation has been the primary focus, staff are mindful of the importance of sustaining technology beyond the life of the grant.</li>
                <li>Organizations can draw from the lessons learned of previous TCE-TAC grantees to determine the features that translate into sustainable practices.</li>
                <li>To promote long-term sustainability, some program staff are developing policies and procedures to provide direction to current and future staff responsible for assisting with service delivery.</li>
                <li>Most programs have the appropriate technical and clinical infrastructure to enhance existing program offerings.</li>
                <li>Program leaders are seeking innovative approaches to fund technology expansion ideas.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>As programs grow, there will be increased demands on staff, which may affect their ability to manage competing program requirements.</li>
                <li>Third-party billing systems (Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance) are important drivers of program sustainability. Many projects do not have payment structures in place to reimburse for the use of technology.</li>
                <li>Billing and reimbursement are complex issues, especially because some States have multiple Medicaid managed-care payers. Each payer has varying payment requirements, which can be challenging to coordinate. It has taken much effort to determine which services will be covered.</li>
                <li>Some organizations have not developed a strategy for program sustainability because they have focused intently on implementing their programs. They lack a robust plan that addresses program design, workflow, and reimbursement, among other critical components.</li>
                <li>Some organizations are in the process of launching an electronic health record system and client portal. It will be important to consider design elements of both to avoid competition and duplication between the platforms. Integrating care across systems and engaging in health information exchanges will be essential to program survival.</li>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most programs offer incentives to clients to encourage continued participation and completion of followup reporting requirements.</li>
                <li>Program staff are motivated to build technology-related questions into their evaluation model to make the case for how technology-based practices enhance client outcomes. Data extracted from these questions will be an asset for future sustainability efforts.</li>
                <li>Staff understand the need for structured data to improve quality of care and streamline documentation.</li>
                <li>Some programs are using data analytic trackers to measure how clients respond to using different forms of technology. These monitoring tools will inform product effectiveness and utility and help determine long-term investment decisions.</li>
                <li>Programs use objective, independent program evaluators to support data collection and assessment efforts.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Government Performance and Recovery Act (GPRA) intake and followup process is lengthy. Programs may have to adjust their workflow protocol to accommodate the collection of GPRA data and other meaningful information.</li>
                <li>GPRA data do not directly measure the impact of technology on client outcomes. Programs must use other assessment tools to determine the extent to which technology is making a difference.</li>
                <li>Long-term GPRA followup is complicated by the transient nature of some client populations and unreliable phone numbers. Obtaining multiple points of contact information and/or identifying usual places clients spend time is essential to meeting followup target rates.</li>
                <li>A lack of access to site analytics creates a missed opportunity to inform evaluation efforts.</li>
