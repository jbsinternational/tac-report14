            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees build on a foundation of prior successful grant initiatives and collaboration among the participating organizations.</li>
            <li>The States draw from lessons learned by previous grantees to inform current implementation strategies and service delivery activities.</li>
            <li>Implementation teams include a diverse complement of primary health care and behavioral health care staffs.</li>
            <li>Evaluation staff members are embedded into both leadership and clinic practice sites, allowing for more immediate data access to support implementation and quality control.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have employed a public health planning model, using population data to target screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) services.</li>
            <li>Many grantees have developed policies and procedures manuals for the delivery and operation of SBIRT services.</li>
            <li>Many States have significantly invested in infrastructure that supports grant implementation, including the following: Web-based data reporting systems; training and workforce development capacity; performance-based contracting with providers; and the use of population data and evaluation findings to support planning, implementation, and management decisions.</li>
            <li>To promote cultural competence, grantees have engaged consumers and representatives from faith-based communities, rural health organizations, the military, and the Indian Health Service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementation of SBIRT is part of the strategic vision for States. Senior State leaders are highly committed to adopting SBIRT within primary care and other systems and are proactive in supporting integration between primary care and behavioral health.</li>
            <li>SBIRT leadership teams consist of experienced Federal grants managers, teams of State personnel, and key partners with prior successful experience managing large and sometimes complicated grants.</li>
            <li>Grantees have been successfully implementing policy steering committees (PSCs) that include senior leadership from State government and key community stakeholders, including regulators, primary care and behavioral health provider associations, the recovery community, the military, and others.</li>
            <li>PSCs provide input to program leadership, address policy issues, and support sustainability and implementation statewide.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantee staff involved in managing and implementing the SBIRT programs are generally located at multiple agencies. Although this situation offers many advantages, it sometimes presents challenges with oversight and management of grant activities, decisionmaking, communication, and coordination.</li>
            <li>One grantee has a newly formed State agency that resulted from a merger of substance abuse and mental health services. Significant turnover in staff leadership occurred as a result of the merger, and the grantee experienced startup delays and fell behind on its performance targets.</li>
            <li>Some PSCs have no representation from external agencies, professional organizations, or other State agencies.</li>
            <li>Physicians are underrepresented on some PSCs.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees have successful working relationships with high-level champions such as State Medicaid directors and leadership from primary care associations that represent community health centers and substance use and mental health service providers.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have formed collaborative relationships with local National Guard facilities in delivering SBIRT and providing access to appropriate and timely care for soldiers and their families, serving as a model for other grantees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One State’s central partner is a multi-organizational health collaborative that is undergoing a significant planning and reorganization process to become an accountable care organization. The State will need to clarify and negotiate common ground and expectations for SBIRT and integrated behavioral health care services within its partner’s emerging system.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees have developed detailed logic models that outline the SBIRT grant implementation process.</li>
            <li>Grantee implementation models address organizational structure, workflow process, context, and culture. Furthermore, they address interorganizational relationships, dissemination of program-specific content knowledge, leadership, and planning.</li>
            <li>Grantees have successfully implemented SBIRT in numerous primary care clinics, federally qualified health centers, faith-based organizations, National Guard facilities, hospitals serving army bases, and other sites.</li>
            <li>Grantee implementation teams work with each site to tailor the implementation to the unique needs of the site and the populations it serves and to embed SBIRT into the routine workflow and culture—sometimes with the aid of a NIATx “walk-through” strategy.</li>
            <li>Program staff members appear committed to working with implementation sites to fully adopt SBIRT; likewise, providers at the sites strongly support the SBIRT model and are committed to successful implementation with their client populations.</li>
            <li>Grantees provide orientation and training to all levels of staff at practice sites.</li>
            <li>Grantee staff members have established good working relationships with the various SBIRT providers. Program coordinators provide ongoing guidance and support to the providers and assist them with overcoming implementation challenges.</li>
            <li>Grantees have implemented systems of regular communication with providers.</li>
            <li>At each implementation site, grantees recruit and nurture practice champions who support and guide implementation into the site; practice sites help identify SBIRT champions.</li>
            <li>Despite initial hesitation, physicians and allied primary care staff are highly supportive of the SBIRT process and the enhanced behavioral health and primary care collaboration.</li>
            <li>Grantees demonstrate an understanding of cultural competence and patient demographics at the various sites and have tailored clinic services accordingly.</li>
            <li>Grantees use sophisticated data systems to support and monitor operations.</li>
            <li>Grantees use data-driven planning processes to determine service areas and contract with service providers in those communities.</li>
            <li>Practice sites use technology and a team approach to support the delivery of SBIRT services.</li>
            <li>Most practice sites are embedding SBIRT into their electronic medical records (EMRs). EMRs track SBIRT patient encounters and include uploaded screening tools, prepopulated templates, and American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) patient placement criteria to support appropriate documentation and to inform referrals.</li>
            <li>Programs have systems in place to monitor and support fidelity of implementation and model adherence.</li>
            <li>Many practice sites have co-located or integrated behavioral health staff who provide full screening, brief intervention, brief treatment, and referral to specialty care.</li>
            <li>Sites are successfully serving diverse patient populations.</li>
            <li>Many sites have adopted evidence-based strategies for patient engagement and retention. As a result, most brief treatment patients are being seen for increasing numbers of sessions.</li>
            <li>Many practice sites employ “warm handoffs” for patients referred to brief treatment or specialty care. This practice has greatly enhanced followthrough of patients into services.</li>
            <li>SBIRT implementation has been particularly successful in some State National Guard facilities: National Guard SBIRT teams deliver screening, brief intervention, and brief treatment, including brief treatment in remote locations through telehealth.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees that have chosen diverse geographic locations, cultures, and practice settings for SBIRT implementation have needed to develop and adopt multiple strategies, requiring more staff time and resources for implementation.</li>
            <li>Most grantees have no interface between the EMRs and the Web-based reporting systems. Staff must, therefore, make dual entries.</li>
            <li>Insurance reimbursement for SBIRT is partially or fully operational in many grantee States. However, providers are unfamiliar with the business practices associated with SBIRT, including insurance coding, billing, and integration and documentation of SBIRT in EMRs.</li>
            <li>In some States, Medicaid regulations limit access to same-day services. This policy poses obstacles for various individuals or entities: for sites in providing integrated care; for patients with multiple health conditions who face access and transportation challenges; and for primary care systems in adopting a patient-centered medical home model.</li>
            <li>Financial and personnel resources are sometimes limited at the provider sites; those sites are unable to dedicate necessary time and staff to effectively implement SBIRT.</li>
            <li>Sometimes practice sites have competing priorities that prevent them from fully implementing SBIRT with their client populations.</li>
            <li>Staff at some practice sites are still learning about SBIRT and motivational interviewing.</li>
            <li>Timely access to community-based substance abuse treatment was described as often challenging.</li>
            <li>A few grantees report that, although screenings and brief interventions are provided at the sites, clients are referred off site for treatment. As a result of clients not following through, many are lost to the program before services can be provided and appropriate Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) data can be collected.</li>
            <li>Physician involvement in SBIRT is limited at some practice sites.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Training and Workforce Development</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees have comprehensive training curricula.</li>
            <li>SBIRT program coordinators often provide motivational interviewing training to staff at all provider sites.</li>
            <li>The grantees have launched highly informative SBIRT informational Web sites.</li>
            <li>The grantees have systems in place to monitor fidelity of implementation within the practice site and to provide ongoing coaching to health educators, supporting and strengthening their practice skills.</li>
            <li>Grantees and practice sites employ a diverse workforce that reflects the populations being served in the clinics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not all grantees have a standard training curriculum or a regular training schedule.</li>
            <li>A few grantees have no system to train newly hired staff after the initial training has been provided or to monitor fidelity of SBIRT implementation with existing staff.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many grantees have initiated multiple strategies in preparation for the changes in their States’ health care systems, including behavioral health/primary care integration, SBIRT integration with federally qualified health centers, and use of electronic medical record (EMR) systems.</li>
            <li>Increasingly, policy steering committees are including representatives from State Medicaid offices, managed care organizations, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield who advise on issues of payment for services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In many cases, there is no interface between current EMRs and the State’s electronic data management system.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>States have identified SBIRT as part of an overarching strategy for integrated primary care and behavioral health services, including patient-centered medical homes.</li>
            <li>Governors’ offices are often actively involved with SBIRT implementation.</li>
            <li>Grantees have taken steps to groom SBIRT champions among stakeholders such as primary care providers, policymakers, and payers.</li>
            <li>The collaboration between many grantees and their local National Guard facilities is highly consistent with the National Guard’s emphasis on prevention and early intervention.</li>
            <li>Grantees are embedding SBIRT into electronic medical records at practice sites.</li>
            <li>Practice sites are generally committed to implementing SBIRT.</li>
            <li>Grantees are proactively developing sustainable business practice models for SBIRT.</li>
            <li>Policy steering committees (PSCs) play an essential role in strategic planning to support sustainability.</li>
            <li>Grantees have engaged payers of services in their PSCs.</li>
            <li>In some States, SBIRT services are currently reimbursable by Medicaid and other third-party payers.</li>
            <li>Some grantees are training non-grant-dependent positions, allowing for service reimbursement even if specific SBIRT billing codes are not activated.</li>
            <li>Grantees are working to fully activate and operationalize use of insurance reimbursement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A few grantees have limited stakeholder involvement and buy-in of SBIRT.</li>
            <li>A few grantees do not currently have a written plan that clearly delineates goals, objectives, strategies, leadership, and decisionmaking in support of SBIRT dissemination and sustainability.</li>
            <li>Many practice sites have not developed a business practice model that would support SBIRT beyond grant funding.</li>
            <li>Medicaid codes are not currently activated in several States.</li>
            <li>In some States, Medicaid restricts delivery of SBIRT services. This restriction poses challenges to developing a viable business model for SBIRT in primary care settings.</li>
            <li>Grantees using a health educator staffing model for SBIRT implementation experience greater challenges within insurance billing and reimbursement because these workers are usually unlicensed, must operate as “physician extenders,” and have limited capacity to bill for other services.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees generally have clearly defined plans for evaluation, including GPRA collection, GPRA followup, and process evaluation.</li>
            <li>Evaluations include both process and outcome measures to inform ongoing program planning and management.</li>
            <li>Grantees have comprehensive monitoring tools to assess SBIRT implementation and fidelity.</li>
            <li>Many grantees have developed Web-based data collection systems that enable aggregation and production of reports on client demographics and services provided throughout their catchment areas.</li>
            <li>Grantees use Web-based systems for collecting and uploading required GPRA information.</li>
            <li>Grantees have comprehensive strategies for client identification to support GPRA followup.</li>
            <li>Grantees effectively use data to support successful implementation and to identify atypical activity.</li>
            <li>Most States have contracted with evaluation and research groups experienced with large-scale followup activities with populations that are sometimes difficult to reach.</li>
            <li>Many grantees have developed practice manuals that detail evaluation activities.</li>
            <li>Many practice sites are using portable laptop computers for data collection.</li>
            <li>Beyond GPRA followup, some grantees plan to conduct formative, outcome, and cost-benefit evaluation activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some grantees would like to interface among the various electronic medical record systems (EMRs) being used by providers, their Web-based data collection systems, and the Services Accountability Improvement System (SAIS). An improved interface would eliminate duplicate entries and use personnel resources more efficiently.</li>
            <li>Some States and evaluators have not fully developed a plan for 6-month GPRA followup.</li>
            <li>In some cases, followup is voluntary and is not being conducted.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have strategies that only use required GPRA data to capture the impact of SBIRT for military personnel. Additional data could provide valuable information to support the long-term adoption of SBIRT in military settings.</li>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many grantees have invested in technologies that support efficient and coordinated clinical service delivery for clients, such as Web-based client portals, text messaging, videoconferencing, and mobile applications.</li>

            <li>The use of Web-based client portals and electronic health records helps participating agencies manage client needs more effectively and increase collaboration around treatment plans.</li>

            <li>Many programs offer client-centered care to engage and retain clients in recovery services.</li>

            <li>Technology enables clients to connect to recovery support services (such as discussion boards) anonymously and at times that work best for them.</li>

            <li>Integrated electronic health records will enhance the ability of program staff to bill third-party vendors, collect patient demographics, schedule client appointments, and access data for evaluation purposes.</li>

            <li>Technology is increasingly more accessible to clients and available in a variety of platforms. Some program staff have seen an increased uptake in technology use among younger clients</li>

            <li>Technology makes it possible to reach clients, partnering agencies, and other stakeholders in ways that were once only possible by traveling long distances. This benefit allows for more frequent communication and increased visibility to foster engagement and participation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Some program staff have concerns about ensuring patient confidentiality and the cost of using certain technologies.</li>

            <li>Integration of electronic health records is complicated when multiple platforms in use are not compatible with one another. In some cases, information is not transferrable across systems. Other challenges include accessibility of client data and certification of electronic health record systems.</li>

            <li>Client use of technology can be inhibited by four factors: (1) cost (many live below the Federal poverty level), (2) inconsistent living arrangements, (3) unreliable access to technology (particularly smartphones with data plans), and (4) lack of support from family or peers who might also be dealing with substance abuse or co-occurring disorders.</li>

            <li>Among rural populations, there can be a lack of understanding about mental health and substance use treatment. Specific groups (such as mentally ill and/or drug-using parents, cultural minorities, new immigrants, non-English speakers, and Native Americans) may be fearful of participating in government services.</li>
            <li>Long-term client engagement and retention in treatment can be challenging. Program staff must effectively demonstrate the technology’s value to clients to encourage staying in care.</li>

    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Technology enables leadership and program staff to collaborate effectively to advance organizational goals.</li>
            <li>When leadership staff believe in technology’s ability to enhance client outcomes, they can see the benefits to the organization as a whole.</li>
            <li>People in leadership roles often have backgrounds in behavioral health care and understand the needs of their clients in ways that support program development efforts.</li>
            <li>When people in leadership roles are well connected in their communities, they can leverage those connections to facilitate external support for program expansion.</li>
            <li>People in leadership roles in the programs are often passionate, dedicated, and forward thinking.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Partner agencies sometimes do not have technology champions at each active site. In many cases, administrators are reluctant to use technology for fear of disturbing workflow practices and concerns over client confidentiality.</li>
            <li>Individuals in leadership roles may have limited understanding of the implications for integrating technology into practice as outlined by the Affordable Care Act.</li>
            <li>Some program staff may view the use of technology as the purview of the IT department rather than as a clinical tool and a means to improve quality care and continuity of services.</li>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Implementation</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provider agencies offer traditional services and an assortment of distance treatment modalities to enhance client recovery efforts. For example, they use electronic health records, client portals, Web sites, email, smartphone applications, text messaging, and videoconferencing.</li>
            <li>Telehealth enables clients to access technology in a variety of ways from their personal computers, smartphones, and tablets.</li>
            <li>In general, program staff have remained flexible in their implementation strategy and are willing to adapt delivery mechanisms as needed.</li>
            <li>In some cases, additional social media strategies have been implemented to further expand outreach potential.</li>
            <li>Technology can be used to support broader life skill development in areas such as employment, dealing with emotions, child welfare, and housing.</li>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees may have limited staff resources to fully implement programs and manage expansion efforts. Some programs may not be able to support growth.</li>
            <li>Staff time may be spread across several programs; therefore, maintaining a consistent focus is challenging, especially as programs expand and client enrollment increases.</li>
            <li>Some technologies are less convenient to use, partly because of unreliable Internet connections in many rural areas. Other technologies are not as user friendly as anticipated. Clients can be less inclined to troubleshoot issues or remain engaged when technology does not perform as expected.</li>
            <li>Integration of technology is influenced by staff workflow within provider agencies. Adoption of new policies and procedures must be consistent with the site’s culture and approach toward providing recovery services to clients. In some cases, this has meant incorporating technology more slowly than anticipated.</li>
            <li>Providers who prefer traditional face-to-face client encounters can be less inclined to incorporate technology into their practice. Such reluctance can delay implementation.</li>
            <li>Many providers are concerned that telehealth options infringe on patient confidentiality, even though the technologies are in wide use nationwide.</li>
            <li>Clients may demonstrate some reluctance managing Web-based aspects of the treatment process on their own. A lack of Web experience, concerns about confidentiality, and a dearth of provider champions could inhibit use.</li>
            <li>Integrating technology such as electronic health records into provider practices requires sufficient training and technical assistance support from system vendors. Time, resources, and willingness to troubleshoot technical issues are often limited in busy practice settings.</li>
            <li>A high rate of staff turnover at partner agencies can hinder the ability to institutionalize new practices. Much time is required to train new staff and refine workflow.</li>
            <li>Some partner agencies have opted not to participate in a program, creating a significant setback to achieving implementation goals.

            <li>A high rate of staff turnover at partner agencies can make it difficult to recruit and retain excellent health care providers whose support can help institutionalize a program beyond the grant’s life.</li>
            <li>In some cases, linkages with other organizations could be further explored and strengthened.</li>
            <li>Several sites that were initially approached to participate in the program determined they did not have the clients or the interest in incorporating technology into their recovery curriculum.</li>
            <li>Program implementation can be taxed by geographical distance between sites. Technology is essential to effectively manage the program among participating agencies.</li>
            <li>In some cases, leadership may benefit from more sustained connections with the appropriate State agencies and community organizations regarding policymaking and decisionmaking related to health information technology and the Affordable Care Act.

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many programs are actively recruiting new community partners to increase client referral opportunities. Targeted outreach to individuals and organizations in a variety of different settings—court systems, health clinics, military installations, behavioral health centers, and schools, to name a few—will help expand service potential.</li>
            <li>In many cases, program staff are using a variety of marketing strategies—such as radio, print, and television announcements—to promote their activities. They are also escalating online marketing capacity by using social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn to reach clients and raise community awareness.</li>
            <li>Many programs have effectively used Web sites and developed tools such as videos and Webinars to create an accessible and convenient user experience for staff and clients.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some programs are unable to support expansion efforts because of workflow limitations or provider reluctance to incorporate technology into their practice settings.</li>
            <li>A high rate of staff turnover at partner agencies can contribute to recruitment and retention challenges.</li>
            <li>Identifying program champions and mentors among agency staff has been difficult. Candidates often do not know enough about the technology to see the value of using it with their clients.</li>
            <li>Several programs do not have a marketing plan in place. An effective plan should outline client outreach strategies, suggest relationship-building opportunities, and include a multiplatform approach to target stakeholders, using both traditional and electronic marketing mediums.
            </li>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many programs are well positioned to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).</li>
            <li>Often individuals in leadership roles are engaged in State and local policy development activities to prepare for agency-wide changes.</li>
            <li>Some programs have established partnerships with primary care providers and are actively working to integrate their systems to support continuity of care for clients.</li>
            <li>Several programs are using electronic health records (EHRs) that have been certified by the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology.</li>
            <li>Many programs are actively planning to achieve Stage 2 Meaningful Use goals.</li>
            <li>Many grantees are strongly committed to using health information technology and other strategies to enhance technology-assisted care.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provider agencies are at different stages of implementing EHR systems. Some have not implemented a system in their practice, while others are using different systems that are not compatible with one another. This can hinder communications and limit the ability to provide the best possible support for patients.</li>
            <li>Modifying existing EHRs to comply with ACA requirements can be cost prohibitive.</li>
            <li>Payment structures may not provide incentives for using technology. Current provider reimbursement schedules are based on the number of clients staff see (i.e., billable activities), and using technology takes away from billable hours. Payment schedules will radically shift under ACA, which will focus on reimbursement for patient outcomes, not individual service events.
            </li>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Sustainability</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many programs understand the value of distance treatment technology related to client outcomes and appreciate the role technology will have on the future of patient care. While implementation has been the primary focus, staff are generally mindful of the importance of sustaining technology beyond the grant’s life.</li>
            <li>Using technology is a means to make capacity-building efforts more efficient. Dollars typically set aside for building development can be diverted to expand technology to a wider target population.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Third-party billing systems (Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance) are important drivers of program sustainability. Many programs do not have payment structures in place to reimburse for the use of technology.</li>
            <li>Some programs lack a robust sustainability plan that addresses program design, workflow, and reimbursement, among other critical components. Integrating care across systems and engaging in health information exchanges will be essential to program survival.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="accordion-header">Evaluation</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Success Factors</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some evaluation and data collection efforts are much more inclusive than what is required to meet Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requirements. Programs have incorporated existing instruments or designed their own to assess technology’s role in enhancing client outcomes.</li>
            <li>Using gift cards and other incentives are effective strategies to boost client GPRA followup rates.</li>
            <li>Extracting data from client portals and using tracking analytics enhance the ability to measure the effectiveness of service delivery mechanisms.</li>
            <li>A comprehensive program evaluation plan and dedicated evaluation staff are necessary to produce robust findings.</li>
            <li>System interoperability expands data collection opportunities.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Obtaining followup data from transient or precariously housed individuals can be difficult. Programs are encouraged to acquire multiple points of contact.</li>
            <li>GPRA data do not directly measure the effects of technology on client outcomes. Programs must use other assessment tools to determine the extent to which technology is making a difference.</li>
            <li>Data collection is time consuming and labor intensive. Partner agencies are reluctant to divert staff resources toward this effort, particularly because of workforce and budget constraints.</li>
            <li>Client data can become isolated when it is not possible to communicate across EHR systems. A lack of access to site analytics represents a missed opportunity to inform evaluation efforts.
            </li>
