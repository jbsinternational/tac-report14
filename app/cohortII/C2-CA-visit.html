<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The TOADS program seeks to ensure that clients with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders have access to immediate psychiatric assessment and development of a comprehensive treatment plan.</li>
                <li>Treatment plans are implemented through a variety of modalities, including counseling through the telehealth portal.</li>
                <li>The program provides value to individuals living in populated areas where transportation and scheduling issues often serve as an impediment to the provision of needed services.</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Challenges</h5>
            <ul>

	                <li>PBH has provided telehealth services since 2009 and has continued to expand technology enhancements through the program.</li>
	                <li>PBH delivers a combination of traditional and telecare services to provide a healthy transition to technology-based services.</li>

	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>

	            <ul>
	                <li>PBH’s work flow design requires all clients to be seen by the project director at intake; the project director also provides services for other projects, resulting in heavy demands on his time.</li>
	                <li>PBH has difficulty reaching the required Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) target.</li>
	                <li>The PBH target population is geared toward clients who require intensive levels of intervention; at present, the counselor is at capacity, prohibiting the program from seeing additional clients.</li>
	                <li>PBH has not established a sustainability plan.</li>
	                <li>PBH’s marketing efforts require extensive driving and staff time to market services to community partners and clients; services are being marketed by the solo counselor and the program supervisor, reducing time available to see clients.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>

	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>PBH’s marketing efforts require extensive driving and labor hours to market services to community partners. Services are being marketed by the solo counselor and the program supervisor.</li>

	                <li>PBH’s marketing efforts require extensive driving and staff time to market services to clients; services are being marketed by the solo counselor and the program supervisor, reducing time available to see clients.</li>
	                <li>Clients require intensive levels of treatment, so it is difficult to provide services to a large number of people.</li>
