<h3>TCE-TAC Program</h3>
<p>The purpose of the Targeted Capacity Expansion Technology-Assisted Care (TCE-TAC) program is to leverage technology that will enhance and expand provider capacity to offer substance abuse treatment options to underserved populations. The targeted individuals may lack access to treatment as a result of transportation barriers, a shortage of substance abuse treatment providers in the community, and/or financial constraints. The use of health information technology, including Web-based services, smartphones, and behavioral health electronic applications (e-apps), enhances the ability of providers to effectively communicate with persons in treatment and to track and manage client health to ensure services are available where and when needed. The program is designed to address gaps in substance abuse prevention and treatment services and increase the ability of States, local governments, American Indian/Alaska Native tribes and tribal organizations, and community- and faith-based organizations to serve their communities.</p>
