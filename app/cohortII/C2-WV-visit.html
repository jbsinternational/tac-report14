<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>FCHS has experience incorporating different types of treatment technology to support an array of behavioral health programs for its clients, including the 1-800-GAMBLER (problem gambler) network, a database for the screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) program, and a prescription drug abuse quitline (1-866-WV-QUITT).</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Program expansion into other sites will stretch limited staff resources.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>FCHS leadership and ATARI program staff have strong backgrounds in behavioral health care. For example, the ATARI program assistant recently completed recovery coach training.</li>
	                <li>FCHS’s executive leadership believes in the value of technology to support patient outcomes.</li>
	                <li>The program team demonstrates passion and a drive to achieve goals.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Partner agencies do not yet have clear technology champions at each of the active sites.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>FCHS has in-house graphic and video support with commercial-ready results. It recently completed an impressive redesign of its Web site with specialized features, such as video tutorials and targeted links for clients and providers.</li>
	                <li>FCHS hired a dedicated program assistant to attend to recruitment, training, and data management responsibilities.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There may be hesitation to use technology, especially from clients who often do not have reliable access to a smartphone or computer or feel comfortable using the technology. FCHS currently offers data plan incentives and application tutorials to those in need.</li>
	                <li>Clinicians have exhibited reluctance to incorporate technology into practice because of billing and work flow issues.</li>
	                <li>Geographically, cell phone service is unreliable in many rural communities.</li>
	                <li>Communications and resources must be adapted to take into consideration clients’ language and their literacy and education levels, which in many cases are low.</li>
	                <li>FCHS is adapting its incentive strategy to reduce the amount of time needed to coordinate data plan benefits for clients who complete four consecutive weekly check-in assessments.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>FCHS is working to diversify its workforce and streamline certification/licensure processes for those who wish to deliver recovery services to clients.</li>
	                <li>FCHS has met with several organizations to increase service provision opportunities, including community correction facilities, transitional living programs, residential treatment centers, student services, and veterans agencies.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Several sites that were initially approached to participate in the program determined they did not have the clients or the interest in incorporating A-CHESS into their recovery curriculum. FCHS is actively exploring partner opportunities around the State.</li>
	                <li>Program implementation is taxed by geographical distance between sites. Technology is essential to effectively managing the program among participating agencies.</li>
	                <li>Licensure requirements have limited the number of individuals capable of delivering specialty services within the State. Currently, supervision laws prohibit the use of technology for training purposes. This has prompted workers to look outside West Virginia for training opportunities.</li>
	                <li>Turnover at FCHS partner agencies is unusually high. It has been difficult to recruit and retain quality health care providers, especially with more enticing salaries in neighboring States.</li>
	                <li>Current statewide payment structures must be revisited. Partner agencies are forced to take on considerable debt while they wait to be reimbursed for services rendered—often waiting 6–9 months.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>FCHS has launched an aggressive marketing and promotion initiative to expand its reach to additional providers and agencies in the State. In addition to revamping its Web site, FCHS developed several tools, such as videos and Webinars, to create the best user experience for staff and clients.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There are many resources available to help clients, but there is not a single real-time referral repository from which clients can identify the appropriate services.</li>
	                <li>Identifying program champions/mentors from among agency staff and clients has been challenging.</li>
	                <li>High turnover at FCHS partner agencies has contributed to recruitment and retention challenges for the ATARI program.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Existing payment structures do not provide incentives for the use of technology. Current provider reimbursement schedules are based on the number of clients staff see (i.e., billable activities), and using technology takes away from billable hours. Payment schedules will radically shift under ACA, which will focus on reimbursement for patient outcomes, not individual service events.</li>
	                <li>Behavioral health agencies within the State are using different electronic health record systems. This inhibits their ability to communicate with one another and provide the best possible support around patient outcomes.</li>
	                <li>Behavioral health and primary care systems are not integrated.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>FCHS has the appropriate technical and graphic media infrastructure to expand current Web applications and product development capacity. </li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>FCHS staff are responsible for serving the program in multiple capacities. As the program grows, this will increase demand on staff and affect their ability to effectively serve geographically diverse sites.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>FCHS’s evaluation coordinator has experience managing SBIRT data and is familiar with GPRA reporting requirements.</li>
	                <li>FCHS has a Web-based reporting portal to track services, outcomes, and other measures.</li>
	                <li>The addition of a part-time in-house staff member to manage data has eased data collection struggles.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Staff believe the goal of providing service to 600 intake clients (as originally identified in their application) may have been set artificially high.</li>
	                <li>It has been challenging to find adequate time and cooperation from the partner agencies to collect evaluation data. Meetings with agency administrators are being planned to address staff cooperation and motivation factors.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>
