          <li>The prevalence of alcohol or drug dependence for most age groups in New Mexico is considerably higher than the national average (6.5 percent in New Mexico compared to 4.8 percent nationally).</li>
          <li>The profile for the population of focus is similar to that of the overall State population in race, ethnicity, language, federally recognized tribe status, gender, age, socioeconomic characteristics, sexual identity (sexual orientation and gender identity), and other relevant factors. </li>
          <li>New Mexico is the most ethnically diverse State in the continental United States (43 percent White, 44 percent Hispanic, 10 percent Native American, and 3 percent other). Spanish is spoken in 28.7 percent of homes statewide, compared to 11 percent nationally, and Native American languages are spoken in 5.8 percent of homes statewide. </li>
          <li>There are 22 federally recognized tribes in New Mexico—19 Pueblos, 2 Apache reservations, and part of the Navajo Nation. </li>
          <li>The population of focus is adults aged 18 years and older who receive treatment in primary care and community health settings and who are at risk for, or diagnosed with, a substance use disorder, with a priority population of Native Americans and veterans.</li>
          <li>Those most in need of services are racially and ethnically diverse populations and individuals who are homeless, living in rural settings, experiencing multiple disorders, transitioning from one system to another, or incarcerated. </li>
