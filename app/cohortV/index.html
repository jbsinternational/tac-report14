<p class="cohort-intro">State grantees in Cohort V implement SBIRT services for adults in primary care and community health care settings. This program is designed to expand and enhance the State and tribal continuum-of-care services for substance misuse, reduce alcohol and drug consumption and their negative health impact, reduce costly health care utilization, and promote sustainability through the use of health information technology. </p>
