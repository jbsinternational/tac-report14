    <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul>
          <li>Among young adults aged 18–25<strong><em>, </em></strong>national data indicate Vermont is among the top five States with the highest past-month prevalence of alcohol use (74 percent), binge drinking (51 percent), marijuana use (33 percent), and illicit drug use other than marijuana (11 percent).</li>
          <li>The primary target group is low-income, racially/ethnically diverse adults with limited formal education. These individuals are less likely to access behavioral health services, and they represent a large percentage of those served. </li>
          <li>The secondary target group is young adults aged 18–25. This cohort has a high rate of misuse of alcohol and other drugs and has the highest unmet need for receiving treatment.</li>
          <li>Among individuals served by the FQHCs and free clinics, approximately one-half to two-thirds receive Medicaid/Medicare, and the majority of sites report more than 18 percent of their patients as uninsured. Between 55 percent and 100 percent of the FQHC and clinic patients are living below the national poverty level. </li>
          <li>In one of the largest participating FQHCs—Burlington&rsquo;s Community Health Center—11 percent of the patients are homeless, 28 percent identify as belonging to a culturally diverse race, and 11 percent are best served in a language other than English.</li>
          <li>UVM&rsquo;s student health center serves two-thirds of the school&rsquo;s 10,000 students.        </li>
