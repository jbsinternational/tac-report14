        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees build on a foundation of prior successful grant initiatives and collaboration among the participating organizations.</li>
            <li>The States draw from lessons learned by previous grantees to inform current implementation strategies and service delivery activities.</li>
            <li>Implementation teams include a diverse complement of primary health care and behavioral health care staffs.</li>
            <li>Evaluation staff members are embedded into both leadership and clinic practice sites, allowing for more immediate data access to support implementation and quality control.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have employed a public health planning model, using population data to target screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) services.</li>
            <li>Many grantees have developed policies and procedures manuals for the delivery and operation of SBIRT services.</li>
            <li>Many States have significantly invested in infrastructure that supports grant implementation, including the following: Web-based data reporting systems; training and workforce development capacity; performance-based contracting with providers; and the use of population data and evaluation findings to support planning, implementation, and management decisions.</li>
            <li>To promote cultural competence, grantees have engaged consumers and representatives from faith-based communities, rural health organizations, the military, and the Indian Health Service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>None noted.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementation of SBIRT is part of the strategic vision for States. Senior State leaders are highly committed to adopting SBIRT within primary care and other systems and are proactive in supporting integration between primary care and behavioral health.</li>
            <li>SBIRT leadership teams consist of experienced Federal grants managers, teams of State personnel, and key partners with prior successful experience managing large and sometimes complicated grants.</li>
            <li>Grantees have been successfully implementing policy steering committees (PSCs) that include senior leadership from State government and key community stakeholders, including regulators, primary care and behavioral health provider associations, the recovery community, the military, and others.</li>
            <li>PSCs provide input to program leadership, address policy issues, and support sustainability and implementation statewide.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantee staff involved in managing and implementing the SBIRT programs are generally located at multiple agencies. Although this situation offers many advantages, it sometimes presents challenges with oversight and management of grant activities, decisionmaking, communication, and coordination.</li>
            <li>One grantee has a newly formed State agency that resulted from a merger of substance abuse and mental health services. Significant turnover in staff leadership occurred as a result of the merger, and the grantee experienced startup delays and fell behind on its performance targets.</li>
            <li>Some PSCs have no representation from external agencies, professional organizations, or other State agencies.</li>
            <li>Physicians are underrepresented on some PSCs.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees have successful working relationships with high-level champions such as State Medicaid directors and leadership from primary care associations that represent community health centers and substance use and mental health service providers.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have formed collaborative relationships with local National Guard facilities in delivering SBIRT and providing access to appropriate and timely care for soldiers and their families, serving as a model for other grantees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One State’s central partner is a multi-organizational health collaborative that is undergoing a significant planning and reorganization process to become an accountable care organization. The State will need to clarify and negotiate common ground and expectations for SBIRT and integrated behavioral health care services within its partner’s emerging system.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees have developed detailed logic models that outline the SBIRT grant implementation process.</li>
            <li>Grantee implementation models address organizational structure, workflow process, context, and culture. Furthermore, they address interorganizational relationships, dissemination of program-specific content knowledge, leadership, and planning.</li>
            <li>Grantees have successfully implemented SBIRT in numerous primary care clinics, federally qualified health centers, faith-based organizations, National Guard facilities, hospitals serving army bases, and other sites.</li>
            <li>Grantee implementation teams work with each site to tailor the implementation to the unique needs of the site and the populations it serves and to embed SBIRT into the routine workflow and culture—sometimes with the aid of a NIATx “walk-through” strategy.</li>
            <li>Program staff members appear committed to working with implementation sites to fully adopt SBIRT; likewise, providers at the sites strongly support the SBIRT model and are committed to successful implementation with their client populations.</li>
            <li>Grantees provide orientation and training to all levels of staff at practice sites.</li>
            <li>Grantee staff members have established good working relationships with the various SBIRT providers. Program coordinators provide ongoing guidance and support to the providers and assist them with overcoming implementation challenges.</li>
            <li>Grantees have implemented systems of regular communication with providers.</li>
            <li>At each implementation site, grantees recruit and nurture practice champions who support and guide implementation into the site; practice sites help identify SBIRT champions.</li>
            <li>Despite initial hesitation, physicians and allied primary care staff are highly supportive of the SBIRT process and the enhanced behavioral health and primary care collaboration.</li>
            <li>Grantees demonstrate an understanding of cultural competence and patient demographics at the various sites and have tailored clinic services accordingly.</li>
            <li>Grantees use sophisticated data systems to support and monitor operations.</li>
            <li>Grantees use data-driven planning processes to determine service areas and contract with service providers in those communities.</li>
            <li>Practice sites use technology and a team approach to support the delivery of SBIRT services.</li>
            <li>Most practice sites are embedding SBIRT into their electronic medical records (EMRs). EMRs track SBIRT patient encounters and include uploaded screening tools, prepopulated templates, and American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) patient placement criteria to support appropriate documentation and to inform referrals.</li>
            <li>Programs have systems in place to monitor and support fidelity of implementation and model adherence.</li>
            <li>Many practice sites have co-located or integrated behavioral health staff who provide full screening, brief intervention, brief treatment, and referral to specialty care.</li>
            <li>Sites are successfully serving diverse patient populations.</li>
            <li>Many sites have adopted evidence-based strategies for patient engagement and retention. As a result, most brief treatment patients are being seen for increasing numbers of sessions.</li>
            <li>Many practice sites employ “warm handoffs” for patients referred to brief treatment or specialty care. This practice has greatly enhanced followthrough of patients into services.</li>
            <li>SBIRT implementation has been particularly successful in some State National Guard facilities: National Guard SBIRT teams deliver screening, brief intervention, and brief treatment, including brief treatment in remote locations through telehealth.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees that have chosen diverse geographic locations, cultures, and practice settings for SBIRT implementation have needed to develop and adopt multiple strategies, requiring more staff time and resources for implementation.</li>
            <li>Most grantees have no interface between the EMRs and the Web-based reporting systems. Staff must, therefore, make dual entries.</li>
            <li>Insurance reimbursement for SBIRT is partially or fully operational in many grantee States. However, providers are unfamiliar with the business practices associated with SBIRT, including insurance coding, billing, and integration and documentation of SBIRT in EMRs.</li>
            <li>In some States, Medicaid regulations limit access to same-day services. This policy poses obstacles for various individuals or entities: for sites in providing integrated care; for patients with multiple health conditions who face access and transportation challenges; and for primary care systems in adopting a patient-centered medical home model.</li>
            <li>Financial and personnel resources are sometimes limited at the provider sites; those sites are unable to dedicate necessary time and staff to effectively implement SBIRT.</li>
            <li>Sometimes practice sites have competing priorities that prevent them from fully implementing SBIRT with their client populations.</li>
            <li>Staff at some practice sites are still learning about SBIRT and motivational interviewing.</li>
            <li>Timely access to community-based substance abuse treatment was described as often challenging.</li>
            <li>A few grantees report that, although screenings and brief interventions are provided at the sites, clients are referred off site for treatment. As a result of clients not following through, many are lost to the program before services can be provided and appropriate Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) data can be collected.</li>
            <li>Physician involvement in SBIRT is limited at some practice sites.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Training and Workforce Development</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees have comprehensive training curricula.</li>
            <li>SBIRT program coordinators often provide motivational interviewing training to staff at all provider sites.</li>
            <li>The grantees have launched highly informative SBIRT informational Web sites.</li>
            <li>The grantees have systems in place to monitor fidelity of implementation within the practice site and to provide ongoing coaching to health educators, supporting and strengthening their practice skills.</li>
            <li>Grantees and practice sites employ a diverse workforce that reflects the populations being served in the clinics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not all grantees have a standard training curriculum or a regular training schedule.</li>
            <li>A few grantees have no system to train newly hired staff after the initial training has been provided or to monitor fidelity of SBIRT implementation with existing staff.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many grantees have initiated multiple strategies in preparation for the changes in their States’ health care systems, including behavioral health/primary care integration, SBIRT integration with federally qualified health centers, and use of electronic medical record (EMR) systems.</li>
            <li>Increasingly, policy steering committees are including representatives from State Medicaid offices, managed care organizations, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield who advise on issues of payment for services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In many cases, there is no interface between current EMRs and the State’s electronic data management system.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>States have identified SBIRT as part of an overarching strategy for integrated primary care and behavioral health services, including patient-centered medical homes.</li>
            <li>Governors’ offices are often actively involved with SBIRT implementation.</li>
            <li>Grantees have taken steps to groom SBIRT champions among stakeholders such as primary care providers, policymakers, and payers.</li>
            <li>The collaboration between many grantees and their local National Guard facilities is highly consistent with the National Guard’s emphasis on prevention and early intervention.</li>
            <li>Grantees are embedding SBIRT into electronic medical records at practice sites.</li>
            <li>Practice sites are generally committed to implementing SBIRT.</li>
            <li>Grantees are proactively developing sustainable business practice models for SBIRT.</li>
            <li>Policy steering committees (PSCs) play an essential role in strategic planning to support sustainability.</li>
            <li>Grantees have engaged payers of services in their PSCs.</li>
            <li>In some States, SBIRT services are currently reimbursable by Medicaid and other third-party payers.</li>
            <li>Some grantees are training non-grant-dependent positions, allowing for service reimbursement even if specific SBIRT billing codes are not activated.</li>
            <li>Grantees are working to fully activate and operationalize use of insurance reimbursement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A few grantees have limited stakeholder involvement and buy-in of SBIRT.</li>
            <li>A few grantees do not currently have a written plan that clearly delineates goals, objectives, strategies, leadership, and decisionmaking in support of SBIRT dissemination and sustainability.</li>
            <li>Many practice sites have not developed a business practice model that would support SBIRT beyond grant funding.</li>
            <li>Medicaid codes are not currently activated in several States.</li>
            <li>In some States, Medicaid restricts delivery of SBIRT services. This restriction poses challenges to developing a viable business model for SBIRT in primary care settings.</li>
            <li>Grantees using a health educator staffing model for SBIRT implementation experience greater challenges within insurance billing and reimbursement because these workers are usually unlicensed, must operate as “physician extenders,” and have limited capacity to bill for other services.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Success Factors:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees generally have clearly defined plans for evaluation, including GPRA collection, GPRA followup, and process evaluation.</li>
            <li>Evaluations include both process and outcome measures to inform ongoing program planning and management.</li>
            <li>Grantees have comprehensive monitoring tools to assess SBIRT implementation and fidelity.</li>
            <li>Many grantees have developed Web-based data collection systems that enable aggregation and production of reports on client demographics and services provided throughout their catchment areas.</li>
            <li>Grantees use Web-based systems for collecting and uploading required GPRA information.</li>
            <li>Grantees have comprehensive strategies for client identification to support GPRA followup.</li>
            <li>Grantees effectively use data to support successful implementation and to identify atypical activity.</li>
            <li>Most States have contracted with evaluation and research groups experienced with large-scale followup activities with populations that are sometimes difficult to reach.</li>
            <li>Many grantees have developed practice manuals that detail evaluation activities.</li>
            <li>Many practice sites are using portable laptop computers for data collection.</li>
            <li>Beyond GPRA followup, some grantees plan to conduct formative, outcome, and cost-benefit evaluation activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some grantees would like to interface among the various electronic medical record systems (EMRs) being used by providers, their Web-based data collection systems, and the Services Accountability Improvement System (SAIS). An improved interface would eliminate duplicate entries and use personnel resources more efficiently.</li>
            <li>Some States and evaluators have not fully developed a plan for 6-month GPRA followup.</li>
            <li>In some cases, followup is voluntary and is not being conducted.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have strategies that only use required GPRA data to capture the impact of SBIRT for military personnel. Additional data could provide valuable information to support the long-term adoption of SBIRT in military settings.</li>
        </ul>
