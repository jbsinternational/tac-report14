            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Vermont endorses a broad public health approach to substance use and views SBIRT as an essential set of services within primary care. </li>
              <li>The State endorses and supports behavioral health/primary care integration.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul><li>The State appears to be identifying and promoting a model of integrated care that aligns with the unique systems and context of the State.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The SBIRT initiative receives high-level leadership support within Vermont Department of Health.</li>
              <li>The project management team is knowledgeable of SBIRT and implementation of evidence-based programs. </li>
              <li>Vermont-SBIRT has developed medical professional champions who publicly support SBIRT.</li>
              <li>The State&rsquo;s policy steering committee includes high-level representation from Medicaid, private insurance, the health information exchange, and primary care and behavioral health. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>State purchasing processes are lengthy and resulted in startup delays requiring corrective action to meet grant performance targets. </li>
              <li>Nursing staff appear to need further education and support to build their knowledge base and support for SBIRT adoption. </li>
            </ul>
      </div>

                <li>Vermont builds on nearly 10 years of dedicated effort in health information technology. Most primary care systems are currently engaged with the State&rsquo;s health information exchange, and the State behavioral health system is preparing for inclusion. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>

              <li>The State behavioral health systems have lagged behind primary care in adoption of electronic health records. </li>
              <li>Questions regarding SBIRT and other substance use-related patient data sharing are still being negotiated between the single State agency and the State health information exchange. </li></ul></div>
