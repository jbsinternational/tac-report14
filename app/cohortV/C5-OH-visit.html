        <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The State views SBIRT as an essential part of an overarching strategy that supports behavioral health and primary care integration.</li>
              <li>An integrated health information exchange (HIE) is part of the State&rsquo;s vision.</li>
              <li>The grantee has included statewide dissemination of SBIRT in its overall program design.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul><li>Primary care and behavioral health have been historically separated with limited integration. This separation is perpetuated by beliefs and policies that create challenges to integration.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Senior leadership strongly supports SBIRT.</li>
              <li>The grantee staff are highly experienced grant implementers.</li>
              <li>Policy steering committee (PSC) membership includes broad essential stakeholder representation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ohio has both a State and county system of government. The role of the county government in broad SBIRT dissemination and adoption is not well defined. </li>
              <li>Ohio is a large and complex system spanning a large geographical area.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The grantee has engaged essential stakeholders in this project.</li>
                <li>The grantee has good training capacity.</li>
                <li>The grantee has implemented SBIRT services on time using a staged implementation process.</li>
                <li>The grantee effectively uses evaluation data to monitor and support project implementation.</li>
                <li>Practice sites have clearly determined workflow and use a team-based approach.</li>
                <li>SBIRT activities are being integrated into a tablet application that can be uploaded into electronic health records (EHRs).</li>
                <li>All primary care sites have EHRs that can work within the State&rsquo;s HIE.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is limited community-based substance abuse treatment capacity, with few Spanish-speaking clinicians and long wait-lists at certain facilities. This will make it challenging for the grantee to meet its performance expectation of clients referred for treatment being seen within 1 week or less. </li>
                <li>The loss of two community primary care providers scheduled to implement SBIRT services in year 1 creates challenges for meeting performance targets.</li>
                <li>Community behavioral health providers appear to have a range of challenges with readiness and capacity related to using EHRs and participating in the State&rsquo;s HIE.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

              <li>Partnering with Kettering Health Systems leverages existing in-State SBIRT capacity. </li>
              <li>Wright State University provides statewide telehealth as a safety net treatment response. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>

            <ul>
                <li>There appears to be limited integration of the State&rsquo;s community primary care with behavioral health providers.</li></ul></div>

            <p> <b>Challenges</b> </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The active Medicaid codes limit which providers can deliver services and under what circumstances. </li>
