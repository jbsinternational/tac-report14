<h3>What is SBIRT?</h3>
<p>Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is a comprehensive, integrated, public health approach to the delivery of early intervention and treatment services for people with substance use disorders, as well as those at risk for developing these disorders. Primary care centers, hospital emergency rooms, trauma centers, and other community settings provide opportunities for early intervention with at-risk substance users before more severe consequences occur.<br />
Since 2003, SAMHSA&rsquo;s Division of Services Improvement, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (DSI/CSAT) has been providing grants to promote SBIRT practices. To date, SAMHSA has funded:</p>
<ul>
  <li>17 Medical Residency Training Program Grants</li>
  <li>27 Â State Cooperative Agreements</li>
  <li>12 Targeted Capacity Expansion Campus Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) Grants</li>
  <li>14 Medical Professional Training Program Grants</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is Cohort V?</h3>
<p>State grantees in Cohort V implement SBIRT services for adults in primary care and community health care settings. This program is designed to expand and enhance the State and tribal continuum-of-care services for substance misuse, reduce alcohol and drug consumption and their negative health impact, reduce costly health care utilization, and promote sustainability through the use of health information technology. <br />
Cohort V includes the following five State grantees that were funded in FY 2013 and whose cooperative agreements are expected to end in July 2018:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New Mexico Human Services Department</li>
  <li>New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services</li>
  <li>Ohio Department of Alcohol &amp; Drug Addiction Services</li>
  <li>South Carolina Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services</li>
  <li>State of Vermont</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Are there any other currently funded SBIRT grantees? </b></p>
<p>Yes. SAMHSA has active cooperative agreements with 12 Cohort IV State grantees whose SBIRT programs are still active. Nine were funded in FY 2011, and their cooperative agreements are expected to end in August 2016. The remaining three were funded in FY 2012, and their cooperative agreements are expected to end in June 2017. <a href="cohortIV/index.html">For information, click here</a>.</p>
