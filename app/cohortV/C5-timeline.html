                            <p>Ohio SBIRT has integrated SBIRT into primary care and behavioral health services at three federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). The program has buy-in for SBIRT at all agency levels. The policy steering committee includes key community- and State-level stakeholder representatives—the State’s hospital association, veterans services and the National Guard, medical and behavioral health, Medicaid, consumer advocacy groups, and the State’s health information exchange. The three FQHCs use a team-based health care delivery approach. After the visit, the grantee modified its funding strategy for practice sites. In year 2, the program plans to recruit two additional implementation sites and expand SBIRT practices to nonfunded sites.</p>

<p>South Carolina SBIRT has integrated SBIRT into six federally qualified health centers, one rural health clinic, and one internal medicine clinic. The grantee has buy-in for SBIRT at all agency levels, and its policy steering committee includes key community- and State-level stakeholders. Implementation is still new, and several sites need additional assistance. In year 2, the program plans to implement SBIRT in four additional sites. </p>

<p>Vermont SBIRT has implemented SBIRT in federally qualified health centers, clinics for the uninsured, and an emergency department. The program has buy-in at all agency levels. Key community members and State-level stakeholders participate in the policy steering committee. The program shows excellent management, solid relationships with community providers, sensitivity to cultural issues, and readiness for health information technology. The program has experienced delays in signing agreements with high-level partners and difficulty in meeting year 1 target numbers (it will likely make up numbers in coming years). In year 2, the program plans to implement SBIRT in the University of Vermont Student Health Center. The Vermont Army National Guard will help with training and referrals.</p>

<p>New Mexico SBIRT has implemented SBIRT at a federally qualified health center and a community health clinic. Current performance is below target number, and both sites rely on a grant-funded behavioral health counselor and a peer support worker—neither likely to be supported after funding ends. Project emphasis has shifted from the more prevalent mild-to-moderate at-risk population, where the SBIRT efficacy is strongest, to higher risk patients. In year 2, the program plans to recruit additional implementation sites, including hospitals, tribal communities, and other primary care entities. </p>

<p>This second SBIRT cooperative agreement has a strong leadership team, with rapid program startup and SBIRT service delivery. The program has integrated SBIRT into the electronic health record. Partnering organizations are cooperating and collaborating in training and supervising health coaches. The program has expanded the existing policy advisory committee to include workgroups on dissemination and sustainability. The program&rsquo;s model of shared decisionmaking has empowered frontline staff at North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System to recommend approaches and changes in workflow that have increased screening, brief intervention, and Government Performance and Results Act reporting. The grantee plans to pilot electronic referrals and other strategies in year 2 and to create a health information technology workgroup in year 3.</p>
