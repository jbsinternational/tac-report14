            <p>

            </p>
          <ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>South Carolina SBIRT has the capacity to provide training in SBIRT and motivational interviewing at the practice sites.</li>
                <li>South Carolina SBIRT effectively uses evaluation data to monitor and support implementation.</li>
                <li>Nearly all primary care sites have electronic health records (EHRs) capable of participating in the State&rsquo;s HIE.</li>
                <li>The State and counties have collaborated to purchase a single EHR for use by all substance abuse treatment providers.</li>
                <li>The State has most of the essential elements for an integrated data system for patient care. </li>
                <li>South Carolina SBIRT is using a touch-screen convertible tablet to collect and report SBIRT information.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice sites are in the early phases of implementation and are experiencing challenges with workflow, fidelity, and staff buy-in. </li>
                <li>Primary care sites are just beginning to participate in the HIE.</li>
                <li>The CareScope system does not have the capacity to exchange information with primary care, substance use services, or the HIE. </li>
                <li>The substance abuse treatment providers are just starting to use an EHR. Their system has the capacity to exchange information with other systems but does not currently do so. </li>
            </ul>

              <li>South Carolina SBIRT has good working relationships with the State&rsquo;s primary care association and behavioral health provider association.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>

            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The project uses health educators to provide full screenings and brief interventions at the practice sites.</li>
              <li>The project uses patient navigators to support clients referred to treatment.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>EHRs are in use at most South Carolina SBIRT sites. SBIRT is being embedded in EHRs.</li>

              <li>Essential stakeholders and policymakers, including Medicaid, participate on the PSC.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">

            <ul>
              <li>Medicaid codes limit the providers that can deliver SBIRT services and the circumstances under which services can be delivered. SBIRT is not part of the federally qualified health center (FQHC) bundled Medicaid rate. </li>
              <li>Practice sites will need to develop viable business practice models for SBIRT within diverse practice settings. This is particularly true for FQHCs that operate using bundled rates for services. </li>
            </ul>
