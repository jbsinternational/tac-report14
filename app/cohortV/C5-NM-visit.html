</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
          <ul>
                <li>New Mexico strongly endorses an integrated approach to substance use and views SBIRT as an essential set of services within primary care.</li>
                <li>The State endorses and supports behavioral health and primary care integration.</li>
                <li>The State is committed to reducing health disparities and prioritizes services to underserved populations. </li>
            </ul>

          <p>
            <b>Challenges</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The model for behavioral health and primary care integration is evolving. </li>
            <li>The State is at an important time in systems change for the payment systems of behavioral health care.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The SBIRT initiative receives high-level leadership support within the State and within payer systems. </li>
                <li>The project team members offer depth of expertise and experience in training and supervision, evaluation, and implementation. They have full understanding of the clinical, systemic, and cultural issues related to SBIRT and demonstrate much enthusiasm.</li>
                <li>The policy steering committee is composed of leaders who are well positioned to support SBIRT deployment and sustainability.</li>
                <li>Team members are sensitive to the complex cultural, geographic, and economic challenges in New Mexico.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The SBIRT project director is new to her role, managing a complex initiative that includes both service delivery and systems change. </li>
        <li>Grant management is shared among the single State agency (SSA), the University of New Mexico, and the Sangre de Cristo Community Health Partnership. </li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>New Mexico SBIRT has been implemented in two sites serving Native Americans and Hispanics adults.</li>
              <li>Practice site staff demonstrate strong buy-in for SBIRT services.</li>
              <li>The implementation approach demonstrates a high level of sensitivity to the culture of the populations served. </li>
              <li>The grantee is using telehealth for supervision and coaching to support implementation.</li>
              <li>The project team is highly sensitive to comorbidities commonly associated with substance misuse and is implementing screening processes and evidence-based interventions. This presents both opportunities for more comprehensive care and some challenges discussed below.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The grantee is significantly behind on its performance targets. </li>
              <li>The implementation model is based largely on training and deployment of grant-funded peer support workers and behavioral health counselors. </li>
              <li>SBIRT staff and services seem more colocated than integrated. Both sites have permanent behavioral health staff who currently have limited involvement in delivery of SBIRT services. </li>
              <li>The New Mexico model calls for integrated treatment of comorbid mental health issues with evidence-based interventions including Seeking Safety, Community Reinforcement Approach, and IMPACT. This approach is an innovative and ambitious but also presents clinical, grant-specific, and operational challenges, particularly in light of current startup problems and meeting performance targets. </li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Recommended Enhancements</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>GRANTEE-LED ENHANCEMENTS </b></p>
            <ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>Clarify the new permanent project director&rsquo;s roles within the team, and delineate the communication and decisionmaking processes.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>Implementation Plan</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>Develop a defined plan to expand service capacity to meet agreed-upon performance targets. Consider narrowing focus in next year to core SBIRT services.</li>
