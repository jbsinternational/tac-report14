<h3>What is a site visit, and what is its purpose?</h3>
<p>The TAC grantees serve on SAMHSA&rsquo;s front line to expand the Nation&rsquo;s substance abuse treatment capacity—filling gaps in the continuum of care, improving treatment services, extending access to treatment for a range of underserved and minority populations, while using technology to facilitate delivery of  these services. Site visits play a critical role in helping grantees succeed with program implementation. The site visits provide an opportunity for grantees to focus their vision, solve problems, and implement individualized technical assistance to meet specific needs. These client-focused, change-oriented visits are undertaken to assess what is working well, identify what could be improved, and assist in developing action plans to ensure success.</p>
<p>The site visits are based on the following guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Collaborate—</strong>Generate working partnerships, especially with others having different and complementary experiences.</li>
  <li><strong>Analyze—</strong>Identify solutions to address challenges.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment—</strong>Build prototypes and pose hypotheses, test them, and repeat the activities to find the most effective ways to manage risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Personalize—</strong>Consider the unique context of each problem and the people involved.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrate—</strong>Perceive an entire system and its linkages.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret—</strong>Devise how to frame the problem, and judge the possible solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What happens on a site visit?</h3>
<p>The site visit teams consist of staff from the technical assistance contractor (JBS International, Inc.) who engage in several team tasks:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Engage grantees and key stakeholders in meaningful discussion.</li>
  <li>Observe and report on grantee implementation progress.</li>
  <li>Identify grantee strengths and challenges.</li>
  <li>Identify potential enhancements that might be supported by technical assistance, as approved by SAMHSA.</li>
  <li>Advise grantees on the critical issues related to the Affordable Care Act.</li>
  <li>Provide technical assistance as needed during the visit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The site visit process includes multiple components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prepare for the visit, including the review of grant applications and periodic reports and discussions with program staff.</li>
  <li>Meet on site with the project director, project evaluator, project coordinator, clients, agency partners and leadership, and other key stakeholders.</li>
  <li>Tour one or more implementation sites if appropriate.</li>
  <li>Review materials.</li>
</ul>
