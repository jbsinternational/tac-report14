<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>RECOVERe has a clear vision and design to expand care coordination using health information technology in targeted areas of need.</li>
                <li>CSO, the parent organization that includes a variety of programs beyond RECOVERe, supports RECOVERe vision and design.</li>
                <li>All CSO staff is clear on the program vision.</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Challenges</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>RECOVERe is managed by a single project director and has minimal support staff to assist with expanding design.</li>
                <li>RECOVERe is an internal service augmenting existing CSO services. This limits CSO in meeting its vision to expand capacity, as it is currently only taking internal referrals.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The RECOVERe program is embedded within CSO which provides an existing infrastructure.</li>
	                <li>RECOVERe has implemented a designated program director tasked with oversight of all program activities.</li>
	                <li>Strong leadership has allowed the program to be implemented effectively and meet the majority of implementation timelines.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>RECOVERe has limited budget for staff resources and thus limited time can be dedicated to client followup.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>RECOVERe has implemented services on schedule with the exception of the EHR and client portal.</li>
	                <li>RECOVERe is reaching people in recovery daily through inspirational, motivational interviewing-based text messages.</li>
	                <li>RECOVERe has invested significant time and review to identify an EHR vendor that best suits the needs of its program, clients, and partners.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Implementation of an EHR and client portal is delayed because of the extensive process undertaken to choose the best vendor and implementation approach.</li>
	                <li>The program has experienced higher than expected costs associated with the technology used for the Text4Recovery activities.</li>
	                <li>RECOVERe discharges participants after 6 months of services. This can result in the return of the technology, thus the removal of text support received through the program.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>CSO is well established and a known entity within its community. CSO has established partnerships with primary care, foundations, and other community organizations.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The existing CSO board of directors is evolving to include critical stakeholders.</li>
	                <li>Linkages with other organizations could be further explored and strengthened.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The RECOVERe program conducted intake on 117 individuals from January through October 2012.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The program expressed a challenge completing followup with clients due to the limited number of labor hours assigned to the project.</li>
	                <li>The program is currently only reaching clients through internal referrals rather than broader community outreach.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>CSO is well positioned in the community to effectively meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. It has established partnerships with primary care providers and can build on these relationships to integrate primary and behavioral health care services.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Health Information Exchange has not been prominent in Massachusetts.</li>
	                <li>Massachusetts has its own standard assessment forms for service provision (Massachusetts Standardized Documentation Project forms). Even when using these forms, data have to be entered individually in separate systems.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>RECOVERe has a designated staff person to use data to inform services.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The cost of staff time and technologies may limit the sustainability of the program.  </li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <h5>Strengths</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>RECOVERe has a designated evaluator and completed evaluation plan.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <h5>Challenges</h5>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Followup data collection is time consuming, labor intensive, and may prove to take more time and resources than allotted in the grant budget.</li>
	                <li>Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) data collection does not directly measure the impact of the technologies.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>
