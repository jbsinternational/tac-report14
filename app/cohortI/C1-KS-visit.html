<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase the numbers of rural college students seen for substance abuse treatment using telemedicine and provide a high level of satisfaction across clients.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>The program has a strong prevention focus; however, the grant project’s focus is on employing technology in the delivery of substance abuse treatment services.</li>
            </ul>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>

	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>KUMC has the ability to deploy telehealth using flat screens, smaller units (desktops), and iPads.</li>
	                <li>Utilize Second Life to provide prevention, education, and training material to UKMC’s medical and nursing students and to Pittsburg State University students in substance abuse education.</li>
	                <li>Partnership with Central Kansas Foundation (CKF) includes CKF providing the substance abuse and mental health treatment services with KUMC providing the telehealth equipment (Polycom).</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Extensive requirements for collection of data at intake, lead to the decrease in client engagement, thus leading to delaying the initiation of treatment.</li>
	                <li>Workflow challenges affect program participation from other college entities.</li>
	                <li>Security issues exist for the Second Life site and telehealth equipment.</li>
	                <li>Hiring staff to run the program is a challenge.</li>
	                <li>Relying primarily on college students in the longer term treatment model does not allow the program to receive sufficient numbers of clients needed to meet the target.</li>
	                <li>College students are generally a transient population, making it difficult to do followups at 6 month.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Partnership with CKF includes CKF providing the substance abuse and mental health treatment services, while UKMC provides the telehealth equipment.</li>
	                <li>The KUCTT program is an arm of the university’s telecommunication department, which has already utilized its technology in medical specialties such as pediatrics and cardiology.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There are not enough partnerships with colleges to sustain the program.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Referrals are provided by the health clinic, judicial officer violations, student conduct committee, and the athletic department when drug testing results in a positive finding.</li>
	                <li>Students who are referred to the counseling program have different levels of completion requirements and the potential for consequences if not completed.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Difficulties in relationship building affect a process for obtaining referrals.</li>
	                <li>Delays exist in receiving referrals from the participating college’s sanction process because of the academic calendar and school policies.</li>
	                <li>There is no strong marketing plan in place.</li>
	            </ul>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>As a large hospital system, there is already a third-party billing system in place that bills for Medicaid, Medicare, self-paid, and private insurance.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>

	                <li>There is no plan for sustainability.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The program collects currently required documentation at intake including Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI), and CKF’s State-mandated screening assessment, record of consult, and three different patient privacy and security forms.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There is no defined evaluator position or staff member to direct evaluation projects. The other staff members with evaluation experience are taking over the responsibilities.</li>
	                <li>The documentation requirements are too cumbersome and decreasing the potential for quickly engaging the client.</li>
