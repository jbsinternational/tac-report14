<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Most clients reported that the benefits of the mobile wellness program are: 1) constant connection to recovery support opportunities; 2) anonymity; and 3) convenience of use.</li>
                <li>Human Service Center has found the program to be most successful among higher educated, middle-aged, employed clients who prefer this approach to accessing care due to sensitivity about retaining their anonymity. HSC predicts there could be opportunities for scalability within this demographic.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>The ACHESS mobile applications developed to aid in recovery are found to be less convenient to use, in part because of unreliable connections in many rural areas. Therefore, the focus on expanding the use of the mobile application has been reduced, while the Internet-based online curriculum and the telephone access to the clinician have been the primary intervention.</li>
                <li>Issues that were identified with the ACHESS application include: 1) problems with making the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting locator work; 2) discussion boards were not well utilized, particularly if users did not already know each other; 3) slow loading of content; 4) the “other events” portion of the application was not utilized; and 5) the panic features were not well developed.</li>
            </ul>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Human Service Center clients agreed the online modules are very useful recovery tools.</li>
	                <li>Human Service Center clients noted the online clinician is extremely skilled and able to provide valuable input in a short amount of time. The flexibility of the program made it easy to remain engaged in treatment.</li>
	                <li>Human Service Center staff noted the online clinician is trained extensively in providing valuable CBT treatment in less than 20 minutes, and fidelity to the CBT model is rigorously tracked and feedback provided on a regular basis to ensure consistency in the approach.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Human Service Center needed to recruit and develop a partnership agreement with an alternative rural provider which delayed the expected project start date and resulted in a smaller number of individuals accessing the mobile interventions.</li>
	                <li>Marketing is a new activity for Human Service Center staff since they have historically had no need to advertise the availability of their services, nor are they familiar with how to approach hospitals about entering into collaborative partnerships.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Human Service Center has increased marketing efforts using radio public service announcements to recruit new clients.</li>
	                <li>Human Service Center partnered with Sinnissippi Centers which currently provides 25 percent of its referral sources and may be able to increase the referrals when a part-time primary care physician is introduced to the staffing pattern.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>

	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>HSC foresees an opportunity for the program to sustain itself eventually; however, much work remains due to the increased sensitivity to stigma in rural areas and the need to increase training for referral sources.</li>
	                <li>There are challenges in engaging with individuals who have been mandated to participate in treatment since adhering to the Therapeutic Education System protocol and focused clinician contact is in many ways more onerous than coming to office-based counseling.</li>
	                <li>As a result of required training and supervision that is critical to maintaining fidelity to the e-therapy CBT model, the cost of the service currently surpasses that of group-based intensive outpatient services.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The Human Service Center project director and research analyst have a respectable track record in developing successful grant-funded projects and in utilizing existing research on evidence-based practices to inform the program design, data collection process, and evaluation questions.</li>
	                <li>The Human Service Center research team has years of experience in protocol development and served as one of the initial pilot sites for the ACHESS application.</li>
	                <li>Human Service Center is a recipient of the SAMHSA Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Grant.</li>
	                <li>Evaluation practices are much more inclusive than what is required to meet Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requirements. Human Service Center utilizes proven strategies to ensure effective follow up with program participants such as providing gift card incentives for clients who complete the survey questions, which include GPRA data and other data required by their evaluation plan.</li>
	                <li>Current GPRA followup rates are 96 percent.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
