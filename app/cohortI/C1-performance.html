    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Several organizations have longstanding experience with health information technology and a well-supported history of successful program implementation at local, State, and Federal levels, including SAMSHA-funded projects.</li>
                <li>Programs are committed to developing a long-term vision for incorporating technology in recovery services for clients.</li>
                <li>Organizations are moving toward a “whole health” model of care—an integrated approach that addresses clients’ physical and mental health, individually and at a community level. Life skills (e.g., employment, parenting, stress management) are often incorporated in the recovery process.</li>
                <li>Program staff are mindful of exploring the evidence base and cost-effectiveness of strategies to support the long-term success of their programs.</li>
                <li>Recovery coaches are an integral part of delivering care and facilitating program adoption.</li>
                <li>Program staff are committed to minimizing barriers to care and to integrating in-home services (where possible) to facilitate client and staff participation in services.</li>
                <li>Program staff view technology as a means to enhance client outreach and a way to support prevention, treatment, and recovery services. Technology is also a tool to improve overall communication and productivity.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>None noted.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Program leaders believe in the value of technology to support member outcomes and its benefit to the organization as a whole.</li>
                <li>Program staff demonstrate passion, drive, and flexibility to achieve goals. Staff have strong backgrounds in behavioral health care and understand the complex physical and behavioral health needs of their clients across the care continuum.</li>
                <li>Technology is a way to improve leadership and accountability skills.</li>
                <li>Program leaders are committed to partnering with organizations to expand program potential. They understand the importance of sharing information and resources with community partners to provide a full spectrum of services to clients. Partnerships are believed to contribute to the overall success and sustainability of the program.</li>
                <li>Program leaders support cross-functional operations and believe implementation should involve collaboration across all involved departments.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Although program leaders understand the general significance of the Affordable Care Act, there is limited knowledge about its potential effects on the program and organization.</li>
                <li>In the absence of a technology governance group, tasks associated with technology implementation are not prioritized and effective implementation processes are threatened.</li>
                <li>There is a lack of interagency communication and coordination among departments, which can impede the project and organization as a whole.</li>
                <li>Program leaders often have responsibilities beyond their immediate roles, which reduces their ability to focus on project-specific tasks.</li>
                <li>Some partner agencies do not have clear technology champions at each of their active sites. In many cases, providers are reluctant to use technology because of concerns about disturbing workflow practices and client confidentiality.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clients are encouraged to use technology in ways that support their individual recovery needs.</li>
                <li>Program staff have remained flexible in their implementation strategies and are willing to adapt delivery mechanisms as needed.</li>
                <li>Staff engagement and early buy-in are critical to the success of using technology to deliver care.</li>
                <li>Program leaders remain flexible in their approach to implement new things and are willing to adapt existing practices to accommodate what works.</li>
                <li>Focusing on and planning for the end goal of a technology-enabled organization and careful planning for technology use will help support program growth.</li>
                <li>Technology can be used to support broader life skill development around topics such as employment, dealing with emotions, child welfare, or housing.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some organizations may have multiple telehealth and data platforms operating concurrently. There is a need to consolidate technologies without sacrificing performance or functionality.</li>
                <li>Buy-in is essential to program success. Some staff and clients may feel uncertain about the security and privacy of patient health information when using technology platforms. A lack of technology experience coupled with a dearth of provider champions could inhibit implementation progress.</li>
                <li>Technology dramatically affects workflow during the early implementation phase, which can lead to a decline in productivity and staff acceptance. As program participation expands, so will the need to restructure workflow. Without a formal workflow plan in place, staff run the risk of becoming overwhelmed. Changing established practices also means shifting attitudes and behaviors of clinical and administrative staff.</li>
                <li>Roadblocks in communication among staff and departments prevent information sharing, even when departments have common goals.</li>
                <li>Coordinating and prioritizing next steps for implementation will require a detailed project management plan guided by a user group and governance group.</li>
                <li>It has been challenging to implement new technology when there are issues related to general access, Internet connectivity, cell reception, firewall restrictions, and outdated equipment. Clients are less inclined to troubleshoot issues or remain engaged when technology does not perform as expected.</li>
                <li>Providers that prefer traditional face-to-face client encounters are less inclined to incorporate technology in their practice; implementation will require additional time and education to overcome reluctance. Adoption of new policies and procedures must be consistent with the site’s culture and approach toward providing recovery services to clients. In some cases, this reality has required incorporating technology more slowly than anticipated.</li>
                <li>Reimbursement challenges inhibit technology adoption. Few State Medicaid offices have behavioral health specialists and advocates to influence policy and reimbursement considerations.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Partcipation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Several organizations have a longstanding presence in their communities and have established partnerships with multiple Federal, State, and local agencies. Their reputations and voice in their respective communities have facilitated partnership opportunities with a diverse array of agencies.</li>
                <li>Recovery coaches are used by many programs to facilitate program adoption. They are instrumental in fostering relationships with clients and partners to help promote the value of participating in TAC programs.</li>
                <li>Several organizations have connected with TCE-TAC grantees from other cohorts for advise on how to establish a presence in their communities.</li>
                <li>Some organizations are focused on collaborating across agencies to more effectively and efficiently meet client needs. Partner agencies stand to benefit enormously from participating in this integrated approach to care.</li>
                <li>Program leaders are committed to partnering with organizations to expand program potential. They understand the importance of sharing information and resources with community partners to provide a full spectrum of services to clients. Identifying early adopters and champions will contribute to the overall success and sustainability of the program.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Program implementation is taxed by geographical distance between partner sites. Technology is essential to effectively manage program activities in rural settings.</li>
                <li>It can be challenging for partners to fully adopt a new service delivery system when they are emotionally attached to traditional practices. Some partners find it difficult to allow clients to manage their own care, and/or they may be apprehensive about engaging in technology-based care.</li>
                <li>Technology competence among community partners and other substance use providers varies greatly. Some organizations are developing training protocols and using recovery coaches to facilitate adoption of new technologies.</li>
                <li>Staff turnover at partner agencies makes it difficult to recruit and retain high-quality health care providers whose support can help institutionalize the program beyond the grant’s life.</li>
                <li>Some partner agencies do not have clear technology champions at each of their active sites. In many cases, providers are reluctant to use technology because of concerns about disturbing workflow practices and client confidentiality.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recovery coaches are used by many programs to facilitate program adoption. They are instrumental in fostering relationships with clients and partners to help promote the value of participating in TAC programs.</li>
                <li>Program staff play a vital role in outreach and educating the community about the programs and services at each site.</li>
                <li>Program staff are using a variety of marketing strategies to promote their activities. They are also escalating online marketing capacity by using social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn to reach clients and raise community awareness.</li>
                <li>Continued exposure in the community will encourage targeted groups to seek program services and help generate favorable word-of-mouth marketing campaigns.</li>
                <li>Many organizations have an extensive network of partners and referrals for identifying and engaging clients in service.</li>
                <li>Clients have commented on the value and utility of technology in supporting their treatment and recovery.</li>
                <li>Project staff are actively recruiting new community partners to increase client referral opportunities. Targeted outreach to individuals and organizations in a variety of different settings—court systems, health clinics, military installations, behavioral health centers, and schools, to name a few—will help expand service potential.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It can be challenging to manage simultaneous referrals from multiple partner sites.</li>
                <li>It may take time for some clients to feel comfortable transitioning from more traditional recovery modalities. Understanding client preferences for and access to different technologies will assist in outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts.</li>
                <li>Some clients may not have consistent phone numbers, data plans, or email addresses that would facilitate receiving information and/or accessing technology-based services.</li>
                <li>Some programs are unable to support expansion efforts because of workflow limitations or provider reluctance to incorporate technology in their practice settings.</li>
                <li>Staff turnover at partner agencies makes it difficult to recruit and retain high-quality health care providers whose support can help institutionalize the program beyond the grant’s life.</li>
                <li>It has been difficult to identify program champions and mentors among agency staff. Potential candidates often do not know enough about the technology to see the value of using it with their clients.</li>
                <li>Several programs do not have a marketing plan in place. An effective plan should outline client outreach strategies, suggest relationship-building opportunities, and include a multiplatform approach to target stakeholders, using both traditional and electronic marketing mediums.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The organizations understand the value of distance treatment technology on client outcomes and appreciate the role technology will have in the future of patient care. They are strongly committed to using health information technology and other strategies to enhance technology-assisted care.</li>
                <li>Those in leadership roles generally understand the importance of preparing for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and some are involved in policy development activities at the Federal, State, and local levels.</li>
                <li>Most organizations are knowledgeable about the effects ACA will have on health care delivery systems and are actively preparing to meet meaningful use requirements. These sites, for example, have established electronic health record systems that are (or are in the process of becoming) certified for stage 2 meaningful use.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>ACA readiness in many locations has not been informed by a formal planning process. Organizations may benefit from a dedicated strategic plan to help recognize opportunities and challenges related to ACA implementation.</li>
                <li>Reimbursement challenges affect overall program success. Few State Medicaid offices have behavioral health specialists and advocates to influence policy and reimbursement considerations. Several organizations are based in non-Medicaid expansion States. There are also some States that have elected not to implement a health information exchange. As a result, there may be limited affordable health insurance coverage opportunities available to clients.</li>
                <li>Provider agencies are at different stages of implementing electronic health record systems. Some have not implemented a system into their practice, while others are using different platforms that are not compatible with each other. This inhibits agencies from communicating effectively with one another and providing the best possible support for patient outcomes.</li>
                <li>Organizations are concerned about protecting client privacy. Considerations related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act have delayed program implementation in some locations.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>SSuccess Factors:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Several organizations have considered sustainable practices as part of their program design. They understand the value of distance treatment technology related to client outcomes and appreciate the role technology will have on the future of patient care. While implementation has been the primary focus, staff are mindful of the importance of sustaining technology beyond the life of the grant.</li>
                <li>Organizations can draw from the lessons learned of previous TCE-TAC grantees to determine the features that translate into sustainable practices.</li>
                <li>To promote long-term sustainability, some program staff are developing policies and procedures to provide direction to current and future staff responsible for assisting with service delivery.</li>
                <li>Most programs have the appropriate technical and clinical infrastructure to enhance existing program offerings.</li>
                <li>Program leaders are seeking innovative approaches to fund technology expansion ideas.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>As programs grow, there will be increased demands on staff, which may affect their ability to manage competing program requirements.</li>
                <li>Third-party billing systems (Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance) are important drivers of program sustainability. Many projects do not have payment structures in place to reimburse for the use of technology.</li>
                <li>Billing and reimbursement are complex issues, especially because some States have multiple Medicaid managed-care payers. Each payer has varying payment requirements, which can be challenging to coordinate. It has taken much effort to determine which services will be covered.</li>
                <li>Some organizations have not developed a strategy for program sustainability because they have focused intently on implementing their programs. They lack a robust plan that addresses program design, workflow, and reimbursement, among other critical components.</li>
                <li>Some organizations are in the process of launching an electronic health record system and client portal. It will be important to consider design elements of both to avoid competition and duplication between the platforms. Integrating care across systems and engaging in health information exchanges will be essential to program survival.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most programs offer incentives to clients to encourage continued participation and completion of followup reporting requirements.</li>
                <li>Program staff are motivated to build technology-related questions into their evaluation model to make the case for how technology-based practices enhance client outcomes. Data extracted from these questions will be an asset for future sustainability efforts.</li>
                <li>Staff understand the need for structured data to improve quality of care and streamline documentation.</li>
                <li>Some programs are using data analytic trackers to measure how clients respond to using different forms of technology. These monitoring tools will inform product effectiveness and utility and help determine long-term investment decisions.</li>
                <li>Programs use objective, independent program evaluators to support data collection and assessment efforts.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Government Performance and Recovery Act (GPRA) intake and followup process is lengthy. Programs may have to adjust their workflow protocol to accommodate the collection of GPRA data and other meaningful information.</li>
                <li>GPRA data do not directly measure the impact of technology on client outcomes. Programs must use other assessment tools to determine the extent to which technology is making a difference.</li>
                <li>Long-term GPRA followup is complicated by the transient nature of some client populations and unreliable phone numbers. Obtaining multiple points of contact information and/or identifying usual places clients spend time is essential to meeting followup target rates.</li>
                <li>A lack of access to site analytics creates a missed opportunity to inform evaluation efforts.</li>
            </ul>
