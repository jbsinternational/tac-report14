<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>None noted.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>There have been a number of difficulties in integrating the substance abuse program into the existing electronic health record (HER) platform. Some of the challenges included: 1) concerns of the Federally Qualified Health Center’s (FQHC) Chief Operating Officer regarding how to address substance abuse patient privacy requirements (42 CFR, Part2); 2) the information technology lead for COFMC not being sure of how to ensure compatibility with the ambulatory system; and 3) the NextGen Account Manager quoting an unaffordable price of $100,000 to create needed functionality for the substance abuse staff.</li>
                <li>COFMC is using two separate EHRs that are unable to transfer information between the two systems.</li>
                <li>Milan Medical is more user-friendly than NextGen; however, it presents additional problems: 1) information is not transferrable to and from NextGen; 2) it is not being implemented in such a way as to make the patient data easily accessible (staff are scanning forms instead of entering patient’s information); 3) it is not capable of being part of an integrated health care data system; and 4) it is not a certified EHR.</li>
                <li>The clients seen in the program: 1) tend to be below the Federal poverty level; 2) are frequently transient (move from home to home); 3) have no contract cell phones with limited minutes and texting (and they often switch numbers); 4) lack transportation; and 5) multiple family members may be experiencing substance abuse or mental illnesses.</li>
            </ul>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There is not an expectation for universal screening at COFMC for mental health and substance abuse, although such expectations are increasingly considered best practice and will be a part of the required quality measurement expectation of the Federal HIT Meaningful Use program.</li>
	                <li>COFMC projected they would see 500 substance abuse clients per year using Web-based assessments, self-reporting tools, and the EHR.  Currently, the program is seeing 65 patients and not using any of the technologies in the delivery of care.</li>
	                <li>There is a Web site for the program, but not one for the entire agency.  The agency does have the ability to have patients fill out surveys and exchange communication over email via the Web site.  However, the Web site is text heavy and does not provide linkage to patient health records, patient education materials, potential other resources, or opportunities for electronically scheduling appointments.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>COFMC has a history of high turnover and difficulty recruiting which is a typical challenge for rural providers.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The staff has been successful at creating flyers, brochures, and business cards to use to approach criminal attorneys and the area drug prevention coalition.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Due to a lack of technology, COFMC is unable to provide services remotely.</li>
	                <li>The lack of a marketing strategy focusing on a segment of the population that would not be seeking services already available in these counties has led to some provider resistance to the program encroaching on what they consider their territory.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">

	                <li>None noted.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Milan Medical is not a certified EHR and duplicate systems will not facilitate good continuity of care. </li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>While the COFMC does not currently have a sustainability plan in place for the HIT grant-funded services, the FQHC has the ability to bill for substance abuse treatment services under its third-party billing system.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Due to the FQHC and the substance abuse program being siloed, there have been some difficulties merging the substance abuse portion to the FQHC’s EHR-based billing system.  </li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There is no external evaluator for the program and no incentives are being used in the program to increase followup rates.</li>
	                <li>The clients referred through the FQHC are required to fill out FQHC intake information, patient demographic information, and several other documents required for funding source compliance. Once the client is referred to the substance abuse program, they are also required to fill out additional documents that collect frequently duplicate information. This can be overwhelming and burdensome for the client and reduce engagement and treatment completion.</li>
