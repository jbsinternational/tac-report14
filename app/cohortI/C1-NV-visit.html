<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Two full-time counselors and one part-time counselor provide telehealth counseling services through Polycom.</li>
                <li>Netsmart electronic health record (EHR) rollout anticipated within the year, by 2014.</li>
                <li>The EHR system will enhance WestCare Nevada’s ability to do third-party billing, collect patient demographics, schedule patients for upcoming visits, and access clinical information from an evaluation standpoint.</li>
                <li>WestCare maintains constant communication with NyE Communities Coalition (NyECC), the new partner after the dissolution with New Frontier Treatment Center (NFTC), through phone calls, impromptu meetings with committee members, and attending their town hall meetings once a month.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Westcare’s partner, NFTC, did not move forward with the partnership with Westcare after receipt of the award notice. NFTC was to play a major role in providing substance abuse and mental health treatment and client referrals in the rural communities, so this created a significant setback to the grant’s implementation timeline.</li>
                <li>Each counselor is now conducting 50-minute (or longer) therapeutic sessions which will soon become overwhelming as more clients enter the program with only one telehealth hub available.</li>
                <li>The RNTP program does not currently have access to a psychiatrist. There are psychiatrists in local programs, and in private practice, but identifying an interested provider and establishing a contractual relationship has not been accomplished.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The former project director was influential in forming the relationships with NyECC and resolving the technical difficulties regarding the Polycom videoconferencing equipment.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The executive leadership should increase involvement as needed in order to develop relationships, memoranda of agreement, and partnerships with mental health centers.</li>
	                <li>WestCare Foundation’s senior management will need to be involved in RTNP for the program to be operational and successful.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Through AT&T, WestCare Nevada was able to set up working connections in four counties.</li>
	                <li>Many of the issues were resolved by moving the Polycom equipment to the WestCare Foundation’s office and increasing the bandwidth.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Implementation for RNTP was delayed for up to 8 months due to dissolving the partnership with NFTC and the technical difficulties with the T1 lines, which are needed to run the Polycom telehealth equipment.</li>
	                <li>The technical difficulties were mostly due to the lack of technology infrastructure in the nine rural communities.</li>
	                <li>WestCare Nevada was informed that they would have to acquire approval from government officials in order to run the RNTP out of the government offices.</li>
	                <li>Even though a building may have a T1 line, it may not have sufficient bandwidth for the video transmission, resulting in T1 equipment lines going down after less than 45 minutes into the session.</li>
	                <li>The system led to a shutdown and minimal pixilation when too many users were on the system.</li>
	                <li>Resolution of these issues was very time consuming because of challenges with the vendor’s availability to complete repairs in a timely manner.</li>
	                <li>WestCare is experiencing a number of challenges with the scheduling of clients: the telehealth sessions are currently conducted in an area with limited client confidentiality or ease of clinical documentation and there is no automated scheduling process other than the periodic use of Google Calendar.</li>
	                <li>The implementation of the EHR will not address certain issues in locations where there is staff that is not from Westcare since nonstaff members will not have access to the scheduling component.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Because of the dissolution of the partnership with NFTC, WestCare developed an outreach strategy that involved developing an unofficial partnership with NyECC. NyECC is funded and accredited by the Nevada Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse for the State of Nevada.</li>
	                <li>NyECC consists of numerous members and partner agencies representing a wide variety of sectors interested in engagement of youth and adults across the two rural counties. NyECC has been influential in providing WestCare with much needed access to four of the nine rural communities.</li>
	                <li>WestCare Nevada sought volunteer organizations to provide office space for the telehealth connection and to facilitate client referrals.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Establishing services with sites that can provide telehealth spaces has not proven easy. One of the sites is a school, which closed for the summer soon after finalizing an agreement to host a remote site.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>RNTP is currently receiving clients from criminal justice (domestic violence, drug courts, driving under the influence) and adolescents services.</li>
	                <li>WestCare Nevada is now establishing a means of seeking referrals from an army base in Hawthorne, the forth remote site, for soldiers who have returned from active duty in Afghanistan and their families.</li>
	                <li>WestCare Nevada currently promotes the RNTP through announcements in each of the local community papers.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Two of the sites are not staffed by WestCare members so there are additional issues with managing appointments, scheduling changes, and arranging for introducing potential new clients to the program.</li>
	                <li>There is no marketing/client recruitment plan. The plan should include telehealth open houses and building relationships with mental health centers, federally qualified health centers, and child welfare. The plan should also provide for multiple strategies for outreach to various constituencies utilizing different media.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>WestCare Nevada plans to incorporate EHR into all programs within their organizational site, RNTP included.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Have not focused much on health care reform requirements to better address behavioral health issues</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>WestCare Nevada plans to implement a third-party billing system once their EHR is in place that should also enable billing for psychiatrist services through health insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare and allow for prescribing medication to remote locations.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There are a number of policy issues associated with reimbursement for services provided by telehealth that the leadership of WestCare should begin to address since the investments in technology should provide for long-term increases in access to treatment for rural populations.</li>
	                <li>Partnerships with organizations that can provide space for the telehealth connections have not been successful. Ultimately, more permanent and accessible arrangements will need to be a part of the sustainability strategy and used for criteria for additional remote sites in other parts of the State.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>None noted</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There is not a written or measureable marketing/client recruitment plan.</li>
	                <li>The clinical staff are currently responsible for data collection, which is not conducive for client engagement.</li>
	                <li>After completing the assessment, the client information is not scored.</li>
	                <li>To address collection of Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) data and increase clients entering the program, WestCare will need to reduce the requirements for data at the initiation of treatment, and develop a more effective workflow for follow-along and followup data collection that does not interfere with clinical contacts.</li>
	                <li>The duplication of information collected was considerable across the GPRA, the Nevada Health Information Provider Performance System, CAAPE, and CARF defined assessment elements.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>
