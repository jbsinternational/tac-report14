<h3>Strengths and Considerations for Action</h3>
<div id="accordion-container">
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Partner with women in recovery from substance use disorders and foster health and resilience by increasing access to housing, employment, and education opportunities and by reducing barriers to social inclusion and transportation.</li>
                <li>The technology-supported intervention is used to educate and engage clients during the recovery process and complements the efforts of the recovery coaches and therapists.</li>
                <li>Clients use program-provided netbooks to connect to online applications and modules developed by SPI to support the recovery process.</li>
                <li>The motivational techniques used are client centered and provide peer support for initial and ongoing engagement.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
            <ul>
                <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The program has dedicated coaches, program staff, and therapists.</li>
	                <li>The support from the recovery/peer coaches is so influential that their relationship with the clients is viewed as directly linked to clients’ finishing the program.</li>
	                <li>Team members work closely with one another in addressing clinical, client support, technological, and recovery process needs.</li>
	                <li>Clients are eager to provide feedback because they know their opinion is highly respected and necessary for program success.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Program staff have often viewed the use of technology primarily as the purview of the IT department rather than a clinical tool and a means to improve quality and continuity of care.</li>
	                <li>Therapists are resistant to the use of e-therapy.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation Plan</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Recovery coaches are successful and responsive, with a client-driven approach.</li>
	                <li>Clients are given netbooks and Internet access and make excellent use of the available Web-based tools.</li>
	                <li>SPI has been adept at developing workaround strategies to deal with technology difficulties, such as the electronic health record (EHR) vendor falling short on services and not being able to implement the program using iPads.</li>
	                <li>Clients have the ability to access the technology to search for employment, research available services and supports, and improve computer skills.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There is a lack of automated technology training options for clients; as a result, recovery coaches spend time on nontherapeutic issues that could be better spent on addressing clients’ challenges.</li>
	                <li>Therapists are not comfortable with the technology and find streaming e-therapy burdensome. While clients seem comfortable with the technology, they also dislike the video and voice delays during the e-therapy sessions; e-therapy technology signal issues and video delays affect the usability of the technology.</li>
	                <li>It has been difficult to reach the required Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) target of 80 percent of the annual goal; one challenge relates to technological setbacks, such as having to end the CareCloud contract; there is currently a static portal that cannot provide engagement or evaluation of the program; other challenges have related to the development of relationships with referral sources.</li>
	                <li>Planning for how to best sustain the project has not begun.</li>
	                <li>Clients would like more resources readily available that coincide with their individual recovery goals.</li>
	                <li>The organization lacks a strategic plan to guide how technology will be deployed and integrated into clinical work flows and operations.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Staff have strong professional relationships with the community of substance abuse, mental health, social service, and primary care providers.</li>
	                <li>Memorandums of understanding have been developed with community organizations, such as Broward Addiction Recovery Center and Broward Center.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Outreach is difficult with certain providers because of their reluctance to make referrals and collaborate.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Client Outreach, Recruitment, and Referral</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There are many outreach efforts in place, targeting both individuals and organizations, specifically the court system.</li>
	                <li>Other referral sources include active contact and professional relationships with community leaders, judges, agency executives, halfway houses, and residential groups.</li>
	                <li>Some outreach tools include presentations, emails, and flyers.</li>
	                <li>There is specific outreach to the court system, such as the Dependency Drug Court.</li>
	                <li>Efforts are under way to reach clients directly who are mandated for treatment in the public sector.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There is difficulty reaching out to organizations not always directly associated with substance abuse, such as women’s health providers.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>	    

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>SPI is staffed with experienced technology and compliance managers in their IT department.</li>
	                <li>Clients are at ease using the Web portal and see it as an added benefit to assist them in recovery.</li>
	                <li>There is strong agency commitment to using health information technology and other strategies to enhance technology-assisted care.</li>
	                <li>Agency leadership is engaged in State and local policy development activities regarding many aspects of health reform.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The selected technologies have not been able to deliver the services as promised, resulting in implementation delays and cancellation in the contract with the EHR provider.</li>
	                <li>The organization would benefit from undertaking an organizational readiness assessment for health reform.</li>
	                <li>Many therapists are uncomfortable conducting e-therapy sessions.</li>
	                <li>Automatic software updates on netbooks cause problems for the client using the netbook, thereby creating an interruption in the recovery process.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>SPI was granted approval to expand its target population to include women who abuse all drugs, not only prescription drugs.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Most of the program’s focus has been on addressing current issues rather than long-term needs, given the changing landscape of health care services provision.</li>
	            </ul>
	    </div>

	<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
	    <div class="accordion-content">
	        <p><b>Strengths</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>There is a comprehensive approach in place for project evaluation using analytics and data tracking tools.</li>
	                <li>Surveys and data collection tools are used to evaluate satisfaction, engagement, and retention Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) (baseline, 6 months, and discharge) and other outcomes.</li>
	                <li>SPI analyzes GPRA outcomes, including family and living conditions, employment status, social connectedness, criminal justice status, physical health, and trauma.</li>
	                <li>The grantee’s process evaluation includes procedures, project intervention protocols, and adherence to the original design.</li>
	                <li>SPI’s outcome evaluation includes effects of the program on participants, external and personal factors associated with outcomes, and sustainability of the effects.</li>
	                <li>SPI is strongly invested in sharing the results of data collection efforts with agency staff for quality improvement purposes.</li>
	            </ul>
	        <p><b>Challenges</p></b>
	            <ul>
	                <li>The static portal inhibits collection of more dynamic data.</li>
	            </ul>
