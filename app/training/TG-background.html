<h3>What is SBIRT?</h3>
<p>Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is a comprehensive, integrated, public health approach to the delivery of early intervention and treatment services for people with substance use disorders, as well as those at risk for developing these disorders. Primary care centers, hospital emergency rooms, trauma centers, and other community settings provide opportunities for early intervention with at-risk substance users before more severe consequences occur.</p>
<p>Since 2003, SAMHSA&rsquo;s Division of Services Improvement, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (DSI/CSAT) has been providing grants to promote SBIRT practices. To date, SAMHSA has funded:</p>
<ul>
  <li>17 Medical Residency Training Program Grants</li>
  <li>27 Â State Cooperative Agreements</li>
  <li>12 Targeted Capacity Expansion Campus Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) Grants</li>
  <li>14 Medical Professional Training Program Grants</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the Medical Residency Training Program?</h3>
<p> Grantees in the SBIRT Medical Professional Training Program (referred to as Training grantees) develop and implement programs to teach health care professionals (medical residents and students of nursing, social work, and counseling) the skills necessary to provide evidence-based SBIRT services to patients at risk for a substance use disorder. These programs teach health care professionals in both didactic and practice settings and aim to increase the adoption and practice of SBIRT throughout the health care delivery system.</p>
<p>The following 14 SBIRT Training grantees were funded in FY 2013, and their grants are expected to end in August 2016:</p>

  <li>Allegheny-Singer Research Institute (Pittsburgh, PA)</li>
