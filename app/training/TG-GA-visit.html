        <h3 class="accordion-header">PROGRAM VISION AND DESIGN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul><li>Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) students trained through this grant are positioned to become SBIRT practitioners and advocates.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b><b></b></p>
            <ul>
      <li>The 19-module curriculum could seem overwhelming to site coordinators and faculty.       </li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE LEADERSHIP</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul><li>The Southeast Consortium for Substance Abuse Training (SECSAT)-APRN program has an extremely competent and experienced team that has implemented several multisite SBIRT projects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
      <li>The council of directors is composed mainly of staff directly involved in the project.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p><b>Strength</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>With the mix of standardized, nurse-specific SBIRT content and the central management unit administering to several satellite institutions, the model may offer a scalability option not seen in other SBIRT training programs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges </b></p>
            <ul>
      <li>The 19 modules have been developed, but they are not in a useable format.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header"> COMMUNITY LINKAGES, PARTNERS, AND PARTICIPATION         </h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The grantee has developed partnerships with a diverse and engaged group of educational institutions. </li>
              <li>The grantee is part of an SBIRT nursing consortium that should provide support and spark innovative ideas. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenge</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The variations in sites (e.g., size, educational environment) present evaluation and implementation challenges. </li>
              <li>The eight sites are varied in their engagement with the project and experience in topics such as substance use and e learning.</li>
            </ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>SECSAT-APRN is dedicated to providing an experiential learning experience for students.        </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><b>Challenge</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The various locations and learning styles present a particular challenge for experiential learning. </li>
              <li>Many programs do not have in-house clinics and therefore have little control over the preceptors. </li>
              <li>Even more challenging are sites such as the University of Alabama, where all the learning is virtual; students and preceptors are spread across the country, and staff have little to no interaction with them.</li></ul></div>



<h3 class="accordion-header">AFFORDABLE CARE ACT READINESS</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>SECSAT-APRN is filling a gap in nursing education by training nurses to integrate behavioral health prevention activities into medical settings. </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><b>Challenge</b></p>
          <ul>
      <li>None identified.</li></ul></div>
              
              <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
          <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>All the content has been modified to be relevant to nurses, and the variety of modules helps ensure the content is relevant to programs with different focuses.</li>
          </ul>
          
        <p><b>Challenge</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li> SECSAT-APRN would like the sites to embed the modules into their own learning management systems. </li>
      <li>Very few resources are being provided to implementation sites.</li></ul></div>


<h3 class="accordion-header">RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
          <ul>
            <li>Program Vision and Design
              <ul>
                <li>Consider clarifying that there is a core curriculum of three courses and that sites can choose to add a small amount of more specified content (e.g., pain and addiction). This clarification might make the 19-module curriculum seem more manageable. </li>
                <li>Consider shortening the core modules and reducing the hours of required SBIRT content.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Grantee Leadership
              <ul>
                <li>Consider creating a more diverse council of directors by recruiting members from outside the grant and the schools of nursing. It would be helpful to have representatives from clinics and hospitals where nursing students follow their courses of study, leaders in the various schools of medicine, and champions from behavioral health (e.g., psychology, social work). </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Implementation Plan
              <ul>
                <li>As planned, modify the brief negotiated interview curriculum from a five-step process to a four-step process. This change will enable the program to use Yale&rsquo;s full suite of available training resources, including a manual, training video, psychometrically validated practitioner adherence scale, virtual (online) training coach, practice cases, etc. (see<a href="http://www.yale.edu/sbirt" target="_blank"> www.yale.edu/sbirt</a>).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation
              <ul>
                <li>Consider additional outreach.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Experiential Learning
              <ul>
                <li>Consider training preceptors through an online module because preceptor training is critical to the experiential learning process. The more difficult the preceptors are to reach, the shorter and more streamlined the training should be. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Potential Technical Assistance Requests</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Implementation Plan
              <ul>
                <li>As requested, obtain technical assistance to convert the modules into functional online learning tools—either narrated PowerPoints or more interactive, facilitated online modules. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Experiential Learning
              <ul>
                <li>Consider providing a real-time student interaction through a learning management system such as Blackboard Collaborate or even Google Hangout.</li>
                <li>Consider an algorithmic simulated patient as another option for experiential learning. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Sustainability Planning
              <ul>
                <li>Consider having the central management unit act as technical assistance provider to the sites because sites have much responsibility and few full-time staff. They could provide direct guidance and training.</li>
                <li>Consider employing the SAMHSA-funded technical assistance mechanism through JBS International. The more intensive the capacity-building efforts, the greater likelihood SBIRT will be sustained at each site.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Grantee Evaluation
              <ul>
                <li>Consider having the SECSAT-APRN central management unit evaluation team provide technical assistance on research and evaluation activities to site coordinators.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
