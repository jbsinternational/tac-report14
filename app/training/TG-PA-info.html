    <h3 class="accordion-header">Population Served</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul>
          <li>The patient population in Allegheny County—where most residents, medical students, and nursing students would engage in a clinical rotation—has a mean age of 41.3; is 81.5 percent White and 13.2 percent Black; and has a per capita income of $29,436. </li>
          <li>The ED patients have a lower socioeconomic status and use the ED for primary care. The ED has a high prevalence of patients with substance use disorders, chronic and unstable illnesses, and serious and persistent mental illness.</li>
          <li>The patients at community-based primary care sites reflect the demographics in the community where the care site is located, with one exception—persons aged 18–30 do not access primary care often, except for incidental acute illnesses.</li>
          <li>Urgent care patients are often underinsured (in a lower, but not the lowest, socioeconomic strata), aged 18–30, and do not have a primary care physician; or they are older persons with chronic illnesses.</li>
          <li>Long-term care facility patients are older persons with chronic illnesses, end-stage illnesses, and various disabilities.</li>
          <li>Hospital care patients and hospital pharmacy patients are from all socioeconomic levels. They are often older and have chronic illnesses or are younger and have acute illnesses. </li>
          <li>The community pharmacy has a bimodal population of children who need treatment for acute illnesses and older persons who need chronic disease medications.</li>
          <li>Patients in clinics and FQHCs are often in lower socioeconomic strata and are underemployed, unemployed, homeless, or precariously housed. They have a higher prevalence of behavioral health problems.</li>
