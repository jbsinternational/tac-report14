        <h3 class="accordion-header">PROGRAM VISION AND DESIGN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The core content and customizable third module of the SBIRT training is an effective approach and enables each partner department to integrate training in a way that works best for a specific program.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Plans are not well established for training faculty, field supervisors, and other community partners who will be involved in administering and modeling the SBIRT training with students, residents, and professionals in the community.</li>
              <li>The SBIRT training vision and design emphasizes substance use disorders and not at-risk misuse. The SBIRT intervention is intended to target risky users and is most effective with that population. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header"> GRANTEE LEADERSHIP</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The core grantee staff and university faculty and leadership are committed to incorporating SBIRT in their academic programs, and they seem to understand and appreciate the critical importance of the experiential component of the training. </li>
              <li>The grantee&rsquo;s council of directors is composed of representatives from each participating academic discipline and key community partners and stakeholders invested in the project&rsquo;s success.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The project has made significant progress on its implementation plan in a short time, including forming its council of directors and developing a three-module SBIRT training curriculum to be disseminated across disciplines. The curriculum is currently being rolled out to the nursing and rehabilitation counseling students.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plans for implementing the experiential component in some disciplines have not been fully developed. Some disciplines are planning to implement this component online—therefore, students might not fully appreciate the experience of implementing SBIRT with patients in practice settings.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">COMMUNITY LINKAGES, PARTNERS, AND PARTICIPATION</h3>
