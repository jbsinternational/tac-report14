        <h3 class="accordion-header">PROGRAM VISION AND DESIGN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The program seeks to increase use of SBIRT in health care and social service settings in impoverished, underserved areas of the Bronx, New York, and surrounding urban communities.</li>
              <li>Both the social work students at Lehman College and the medical residents at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital are ethnically diverse, matching the populations of the surrounding Bronx communities.</li>
              <li>The SBIRT model fits philosophically within Lehman College&rsquo;s Department of Social Work as a strengths-based approach to working with clients.</li>
              <li>Lehman College&rsquo;s Department of Social Work has been designated by the New York Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services as an accredited education and training provider for undergraduate social work majors wishing to become a Credentialed Alcohol and Substance Abuse Counselor trainee.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE LEADERSHIP</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Lehman College SBIRT medical professional training program has a defined project structure organized under the project director with three primary teams, each having clearly defined roles and headed by a chair. </li>
              <li>The council of directors is represented by leadership of Lehman College and the Department of Social Work, Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, the New York City Department of Mental Hygiene, and a large substance abuse/heath care organization in the Bronx.</li>
              <li>The council of directors has met three times since the grant was awarded in September 2013 to focus on facilitating the social work trainees&rsquo; ability to perform SBIRT in their field placements, evaluating the trainees&rsquo; use of SBIRT, tracking the use of SBIRT with patients, and planning for program sustainability. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
        <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lehman College has met its program implementation goals for developing the project&rsquo;s organizational structure, developing training materials, cultivating linkages and partnerships, training faculty trainers/medical residency trainers and preceptors and field instructors, training students and medical residents, collecting evaluation data, and submitting Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) data. </li>
              <li>The council of directors is addressing project implementation challenges.</li>
              <li>Training is provided to residents at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital on site by three trainers. </li>
              <li>Bronx-Lebanon pediatric residency has three training program trainers: the program director, a preceptor, and a social worker. The pediatric training program director is an SBIRT champion. The social worker is adjunct faculty at Lehman College.</li>
              <li>The Lehman College Social Work Department has trained B.A. and M.S.W. students in SBIRT. </li>
              <li>The social work students have begun using SBIRT in their field placements and are tracking their use of SBIRT with clients on tracking sheets, which they submit to faculty. The students also record their interactions with patients in the delivery of SBIRT and submit the records to field instructors for review and comment.</li>
              <li>The social work students have completed pretraining and posttest training questionnaires, including the GPRA baseline survey.</li>
              <li>Two physicians and 3 attending physicians at Bronx-Lebanon Ambulatory Care Pediatric Clinic are trained, and 42 medical residents have completed 3 of 4 training sessions. The Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble (known as CRAFFT) screening tool has been introduced to residents.</li>
              <li>The 42 medical residents at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital have participated in 3 training sessions. An additional training session will be provided in April. (The trainers felt the residents needed more time to role-play and absorb the material before using it with patients.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Both social work faculty and students noted the curriculum is dense, with too much information presented in the time allotted for training. </li>
              <li>Fewer than half of the 189 field instructors have received SBIRT training.</li>
              <li>Some field placement agencies have been resistant to SBIRT, concerned that patients identified for brief intervention or treatment might lose custody of their children or benefits such as public housing.</li>
              <li>At Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, additional faculty need to be trained, but there are issues with faculty buy-in and scheduling meetings to discuss SBIRT. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">COMMUNITY LINKAGES, PARTNERS, AND PARTICIPATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Department of Social Work of Lehman College and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital have a strong and longstanding collegial relationship. The pediatric clinic at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital serves as a field placement each year for students in both the B.A. and M.S.W. social work programs. </li>
              <li>The director of the pediatric residency training program is a trainer and an SBIRT champion. Another trainer, also a champion, is an embedded social worker at the hospital and adjunct faculty at Lehman College. </li>
              <li>A primary SBIRT project team, the community agency team is responsible for cultivating relationships with field practice sites to encourage opportunities for social work students to use SBIRT in their internships at agencies where they will be placed for the academic year.</li>
              <li>A director at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and a director at Argus Community (a large substance abuse/heath care organization in the Bronx) serve on the council of directors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Some field placement agencies are reluctant to incorporate SBIRT because of the possible negative consequences for patients who score positive for at-risk use (e.g., incarceration, having their children placed in foster care). </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">LEARNER RECRUITMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strength</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>A high percentage of Lehman College social work students live in the Bronx or nearby areas and are committed to working in and giving back to their communities upon graduation.</li>
              <li>Lehman College is a federally designated Hispanic-serving institution. Over half the students are Latino, reflecting the population of the Bronx. Students in both the undergraduate and M.S.W. programs at the college represent a broad range of cultural and linguistic diversity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenge</b></p>
            <ul>
      <li>None noted. </li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The council of directors is working to ensure SBIRT training will become a permanent part of the bachelor&rsquo;s-level and master&rsquo;s-level social work curricula so SBIRT becomes a routine part of training. </li>
              <li>The grantee is providing four SBIRT trainings annually to health care and social service staff of agencies where social work students serve as interns. Beginning in the second year of the project, the four trainings each year will be open to other personnel (in addition to the field instructors) of agencies where students have their field placements. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sustainability planning is also needed for the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital medical residency training.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The evaluation team has developed four instruments to collect program process and outcome data, including a pretraining questionnaire, a posttest questionnaire, a posttraining questionnaire, and an end-of-semester survey.</li>
              <li>The pretraining instrument has been administered to all classes at Lehman College; the response rate was more than 94 percent. </li>
              <li>The posttraining instrument was administered to all 11 classes at Lehman College, which included the GPRA baseline satisfaction survey. The response rate was 92 percent.</li>
              <li> At Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, 82 percent of the medical residents completed the pretraining questionnaire.</li>
              <li>Focus groups will be convened with social work students and medical residents, trainers, and field instructors to discuss lessons learned to make improvements in subsequent project years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Students&rsquo; SBIRT skills are being assessed, but enhancements to the skills assessment are being considered. </li>
              <li>Pre- and posttest scores cannot be compared individually because students have not been assigned unique identifiers.</li>
              <li>The institutional review board approval process at Bronx-Lebanon hospital is challenging to navigate.</li>
            </ul>
