              <li>The participating site directors from the schools of social work and nursing are committed to building capacity within their schools to give students an opportunity to learn about substance use and SBIRT. </li>
              <li>Membership on the council of directors includes leadership from within BCH and participating schools of nursing and social work.</li>
