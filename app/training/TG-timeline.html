The program anticipates training more than 600 students over 3 years. It seeks to educate students in both didactic and practice settings to implement and promote SBIRT as a strategy for reaching a large number of South Carolina residents at risk for substance use disorders. The program will also disseminate SBIRT training to 4,000 multidisciplinary health professionals throughout the State health care system.</p>

<p>This SBIRT program is training bachelor of arts and master of social work students and pediatric medical residents to perform SBIRT in health care and social service settings in impoverished, underserved communities in Bronx, New York, and surrounding urban areas. The program has made progress in implementing SBIRT training in the Department of Social Work: Faculty are actively involved, a core curriculum and faculty guide have been developed, faculty buy-in is strong, and nearly half of the social work field instructors have been trained. Training for medical residents is in the initial implementation stages: Preceptors have been trained, and residents have received some training. The council of directors is active and has met to discuss social work trainees’ practice of SBIRT in field placements, tracking and evaluating trainees’ use of SBIRT, and program sustainability. To encourage students and residents to use SBIRT after they complete training, the program’s community agency team will work toward cultivating relationships with field practice sites and preceptors.</p>

The program also plans to integrate the SBIRT curriculum in select courses across Indiana, create tailored Web-based educational modules, conduct face-to-face motivational interviewing training, and partner with behavioral health and primary care entities to diffuse SBIRT throughout the community. So far, the online curriculum modules and training materials are nearly complete. Implementation is planned to begin in the School of Social Work in June 2014 and in the School of Nursing and the College of Medicine in fall 2014. More than 50 sites are planned for student and medical resident internships and field placements. </p>

 <p>The Southeast Consortium for Substance Abuse Training: Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) SBIRT program plans to train about 1,500 master’s-level APRN students plus faculty and preceptors at 8 universities in Alabama, Georgia, and Maryland. Each site has a coordinator responsible for integrating SBIRT into the school’s curriculum, coordinating faculty and preceptors, developing a plan to measure student performance, and serving on the council of directors. The program model offers a mix of standardized nurse-specific SBIRT content and a central management unit administering to several satellite institutions. To date, the program has trained all site coordinators, developed all 19 training modules, and is using excellent evaluation tools. At least two faculty per site are to be trained. </p>
