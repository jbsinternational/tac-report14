    <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE LEADERSHIP</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Principal investigators, program directors, faculty, and team leaders among various grantees have a wealth of past experience in research, education, training, and clinical practice in areas such as addiction medicine, substance abuse treatment in clinical practice, addiction psychiatry, opioid issues, prescription drug abuse, methadone, pharmacotherapy, neuropharmacology, and  buprenorphine.</li>
          <li>Leadership at many programs had prior knowledge of and experience with screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) from previous SBIRT grants. This foundation brought several benefits: (1) provided a strong launch for the medical residency programs; (2) helped secure buy-in during the early stages of program development; (3) facilitated applying SBIRT components and principles in clinical settings; (4) brought existing networks of community partnerships and linkages to provide referrals; and (5) helped further SBIRT sustainability efforts.</li>
          <li>Many grantees had a strong prior focus on mental and behavioral health care, bringing additional advantages: (1) time was already allotted for primary care residents to spend on mental and behavioral health care; (2) they did not have to deal with pushback from primary care faculty for SBIRT training; (3) support systems were already in place; and (4) staff and patients were familiar with incorporating a screener into the clinical process.</li>
          <li>Team leaders are involved in evaluating, tailoring, and teaching their curricula to accommodate unique departmental training requirements.</li>
          <li>Grantees employ leadership councils, councils of residency directors, and other committee frameworks made up diverse groups of medical and nonmedical professionals. Team members span a range of disciplines, such as internal medicine, family and community medicine, psychiatry, social work, nursing, evaluation, and other areas. These groups are highly collaborative, engaged, actively promote SBIRT within their departments, and are passionate about creating and disseminating scholarship on screening and brief intervention. They also provide feedback on project implementation and dissemination, ensure that curriculum implementation is effective within each site, work with evaluation teams to assess residents&rsquo; feedback on the curriculum, and advocate for SBIRT training and change practices at the policymaking level. </li>
          <li>Community council members are enthusiastic about SBIRT and express interest in implementing SBIRT in various settings across their States.  <b></b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>None noted</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The various grantees have designed comprehensive and succinct core SBIRT curricula that encompass multiple specialty areas, address numerous addiction medicine topics (e.g., experimental use, repeated use, addiction, abstinence, and relapse), and have been well received by the residents and faculty.</li>
          <li>Many medical residency program curricula were adapted and expanded from existing SBIRT training protocols that employ evidence-based screening tools and interventions. Many were also designed based on faculty and resident needs assessments and were guided by physician learning styles.</li>
          <li>All grantees use multimodal training formats with a variety of interactive components, including didactic learning sessions, small seminars that address SBIRT skills development, Web-based self-study modules, videos, case studies, role-playing, interaction with standardized patients, experiential learning techniques, &ldquo;bedside&rdquo; consults and interventions by both resident and trainer, discussions, preceptor observations, and debriefings.</li>
          <li>The online component of many grantees&rsquo; curricula allows residents to access SBIRT training content remotely, fits the training into residents&rsquo; busy schedules, and broadens the scope of residents who receive training.</li>
          <li>The role-playing and standardized patient sessions in many curricula provide an opportunity for residents to practice brief intervention and receive immediate feedback. Some grantees have state-of-the-art centers that offer technology-enhanced classrooms, electronic commons, telemedicine centers, simulation centers, multiple standardized patient rooms, videotaping of encounters, and preceptor review. </li>
          <li>The experiential practicum component of various curricula allows supervised, hands-on practice with real patients. Videotaped role-playing encourages trainees to critique themselves and provides group feedback to enhance the learning experience.</li>
          <li>Grantees generally employ a multi-tiered approach to their curricula. For example, one curriculum provides core SBIRT training for first-year residents in various specialties, indepth training for faculty champions and resident champions, and booster training sessions for the residents and champions. Another provides two training paths for preceptors and trainers: expert or general preceptor training. Standardized training ensures a consistent level of expertise across faculty. Another three-tiered curriculum provides core training, specialty- and population-specific training, and training for faculty and advanced learners.</li>
          <li>All curricula are flexible, adaptable, expandable, and evolving. Generally, a strong basic SBIRT core curriculum is used as a foundation for customizing to other medical specialty areas, is adapted according to the residents&rsquo; needs and availability, is adapted to the demographics of the patients being served, and continues to be enhanced and updated based on feedback from residents, training faculty, and evaluation results. </li>
          <li>Cultural competency has been built into many of the grantees&rsquo; curricula. For example, one program includes an interactive 16-hour training that stresses community practice with a cross-cultural emphasis. Another program translated the SBIRT screening tools into both Spanish and Chinese and provides a Russian interpreter as needed.</li>
          <li>Several curricula include modules that are unique and noteworthy. Two examples are (1) a module on physician wellness and the impaired physician and (2) a buprenorphine training module for residents and faculty. </li>
          <li>The curricula generally include an assessment component, such as proficiency checklists to assess resident&rsquo;s brief intervention and motivational interviewing skills. </li>
          <li>Many grantees have developed unique materials for their curricula. For example, one program&rsquo;s four-fold pocket pal has proved an excellent reference resource for residents. Another program has developed a comprehensive set of materials to assess adolescent risk of substance use and abuse. Multiple grantees have developed online courses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Because of residents&rsquo; time constraints, some grantees have condensed their curricula. One program, for example, employed expert trainers to create a customized and condensed motivational interviewing training for its residents and faculty. </li>
          <li>Variability across targeted residency program areas (e.g., content area, patient characteristics, practice setting, and workflow) can act as a barrier to standardization. The core curriculum is intended to provide a basic knowledge and skill set across all program areas, and the adaptation component is intended to provide the flexibility to target SBIRT training and education material to the unique needs and considerations of a given residency program. However, program area variability may result in significant differences in curriculum, training design, and delivery that might cause challenges in grants management, evaluation, and other areas. </li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The majority of grantees have departmental champions who have been instrumental in advocating for SBIRT and finding ways to implement it in their respective departments. Many grantees use a physician implementation model. Some programs require each residency site to designate at least one faculty champion to train residents and facilitate integration of SBIRT into clinical practice. Others recruit two or more faculty champions from each participating residency program. These faculty champions implement SBIRT into their clinical practice, observe the residents&rsquo; skill performance, provide coaching and feedback, and gradually assume SBIRT training responsibilities in their residency programs. </li>
          <li>In addition to physician champions, some grantees require each residency site to designate at least one staff champion to oversee SBIRT implementation in the clinic and facilitate the integration of SBIRT into clinical office practice. Some grantees are proactive in grooming and supporting nonmedical SBIRT staff champions to inspire their peers and supervisory staff to adopt SBIRT. </li>
          <li>Several programs allocate grant funding to fully or partially support faculty champions, physician champions, residency directors, or specialty department leaders. This practice allows faculty to dedicate time to train residents and gives incentive to create opportunities for cutting-edge scholarship on SBIRT. </li>
          <li>Training, in various formats, has been successfully implemented among most grantee programs: 
            <ul>
              <li>Many grantees have developed flexible training schedules that allow for individualized resident education over the course of their rotations.</li>
              <li>Residents generally receive basic in-person SBIRT training consisting of various modules plus regular experiential learning sessions with preceptors in the clinic. Many programs provide mandatory training for faculty and resident champions. Booster training sessions are often provided to residents and champions several times per year. Some programs also provide SBIRT training to behavioral health professionals, nurses, and physician assistants.</li>
              <li>Some programs use train-the-trainer models, gradually transitioning responsibilities for SBIRT training, curriculum development, and training implementation to faculty and resident champions during the course of the grant period.</li>
              <li>One grantee focused on deploying a pediatrician-focused curriculum into multidisciplinary adolescent treatment areas across participating hospitals, an implementation approach that has proved beneficial in garnering support for SBIRT implementation across participating program sites.</li>
              <li>Other training components employed by various grantees include clinic preceptor trainings, motivational interviewing workshops, and faculty and chief resident mentorship opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Grantees have successfully integrated SBIRT into numerous residency training sites: 
            <ul>
              <li>Many SBIRT medical residency programs have successfully diffused SBIRT across multiple departments and medical specialties at their respective institutions. </li>
              <li>Screening instruments are fully incorporated into the electronic medical record (EMR) system at a number of clinics and hospitals affiliated with the residency programs. </li>
              <li>Residents are often trained in motivational interviewing to increase their working knowledge of brief intervention.</li>
              <li>Most programs have integrated SBIRT protocols into the routine workflow in different practice settings through universal screening of all patients, identifying patients who have positive screening results, and having the physician complete a more indepth screen, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (when indicated).</li>
              <li>Several medical residency training programs have developed a patient-centered medical home model in which SBIRT is embedded. Physician assistants, nurses, and office staff are included in the normal workflow.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Grantees have successfully integrated SBIRT programs into numerous community-based clinical practice sites:
            <ul>
              <li>Numerous medical residency programs have implemented SBIRT at multiple sites, such as primary care clinics, Department of Veterans Affairs programs, college health centers, high schools for at-risk youth, homeless shelters, substance abuse treatment facilities, and federally qualified health center (FQHC) sites.</li>
              <li>SBIRT is being implemented in clinical practice in communities and cities surrounding some medical residency programs.</li>
              <li>Some programs require residents to visit clinics as an opportunity to learn, first-hand, about the full range of community referral services available to their patients. Such visits enhance resident confidence in conducting referral processes. The clinic is a driving vehicle for integrating systems of care for vulnerable, indigent populations, particularly those in need of medication-assisted therapy (e.g., buprenorphine). It has garnered the support of champions in hospital and city systems to bridge gaps in the provision of community-based health care.</li>
              <li>Programs that have a policy of screening every patient at every clinic appointment are better able to track patient outcomes over time.</li>
              <li>Most programs train allied staff members in SBIRT at all the practice sites.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>One grantee enhanced the existing SBIRT model by developing and implementing a pain management and prescription medication protocol. This model is based on an assessment of patient risk and benefit and is grounded in well-established principles of care.</li>
          <li>Grantees provide their residents with a variety of informational resources. For example, one developed an informational Web site that provides multiple resources supporting SBIRT implementation; another developed a pocket card that contains valuable information on SBIRT for patients misusing tobacco, alcohol, and drugs for clinicians to use in their practice and interactions with patients and as a resource for medical students, medical residents, attending physicians, and other health care professionals.</li>
          <li>Grantees have developed a variety of marketing campaigns and strategies that have successfully promoted implementation among staff and increased SBIRT documentations: 
            <ul>
              <li>Posters to remind physicians to perform SBIRT and comfort patients who may be reticent about answering questions related to their substance use</li>
              <li>Resident incentive programs, including certificates and small prizes awarded to residents who meet documentation goals</li>
              <li>Friendly competitions among residents in surrounding hospitals to determine which setting has the most successful SBIRT chart entries</li>
              <li>Games like BINGO, Jeopardy, and an SBIRT Scrabble tool to reinforce the SBIRT curriculum and make learning fun</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Grantees have a strong focus on collaboration with other health entities: 
            <ul>
              <li>In one case, staff from two Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  grantees in the same city share resources and materials, conduct joint trainings and telemedicine workshops for SBIRT faculty, and share data evaluation techniques to avoid redundancy in material development and to produce complementary measurement tools.</li>
              <li>Staff at another program have successfully collaborated with two other resident training programs and implemented SBIRT in four locations spanning three States.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scheduling training for residents, faculty, preceptors, nurse practitioners, and staff poses various logistical challenges for nearly every grantee: 
            <ul>
              <li>Coordinating SBIRT training for large numbers of people is often impeded by busy schedules and competing clinical and educational responsibilities. </li>
              <li>Training often must be scheduled months in advance.</li>
              <li>Residents, in particular, find it challenging to dedicate time for completing the online modules, demonstration sessions, role-playing exercises, and standardized patient sessions. </li>
              <li>Many grantees note that resident work-hour restrictions make it challenging to integrate SBIRT into resident training curricula and limit the amount of access trainers have to residents. </li>
              <li>Grantees have responded to these concerns in a variety of ways, such as the following: revising the training to be in line with the specialty areas; designating blocks of their education time to teach SBIRT to their residents; and incorporating redundancy into the training system to ensure that all residents are trained. Most grantees are moving toward including Web-based interactive training that will provide more flexibility for faculty, residents, and preceptors. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Time and competing responsibilities are also major challenges in providing actual SBIRT services at nearly every grantee program. Some residents report being unable to perform screenings and brief interventions during a typical patient encounter, and some resort instead to direct referrals to treatment. Faculty members are concerned about the time residents spend with patients and whether it is feasible to conduct screening and brief intervention services in a time-constrained clinical setting.</li>
          <li>Fidelity and adherence to protocols have been challenges for some grantees, as in the following examples:
            <ul>
              <li>Physicians, including residents, at one program described SBIRT as somewhat of a paradigm shift. Residents need to overcome discomfort when discussing and addressing substance use problems with patients and change the historic tendency to automatically refer patients to a social worker to address substance use problems.</li>
              <li>At another program, residents feel pressured by time constraints, language barriers, and discomfort addressing alcohol and substance use issues with their patients.</li>
              <li>Residents at another program provide continuous reminders and booster sessions to increase adherence to SBIRT in clinical practice. Otherwise, the number of referrals tends to drop off.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Inconsistent documentation of SBIRT activities in EMRs at a few programs creates difficulties in tracking, monitoring, and determining the residents&rsquo; fidelity to the SBIRT model.</li>
          <li>Although many department leaders support SBIRT, program staff members sometimes find it challenging to identify champions from each department to promote SBIRT and assist with implementation and sustainability planning. At many programs, buy-in regarding SBIRT efficacy and feasibility varies greatly among the departments. Departments of psychiatry appear particularly resistant, as cited by at least three grantee programs.</li>
          <li>The ratio of faculty champions to residents is a challenge in some cases. For example, one program&rsquo;s Internal Medicine Department has 2 faculty champions and 44 residents. </li>
          <li>Several grantees identified billing, reimbursement, and other fiscal challenges, as in the following examples:<b></b>
            <ul>
              <li>At one program, reimbursement is not available for SBIRT prescreening, brief intervention, or motivational interviewing without an associated diagnosis, brief treatment, or SBIRT followup appointments.<b></b></li>
              <li>At another program, the financial resources available to support SBIRT lag significantly behind payments routinely made to physicians.</li>
              <li>Turning on SBIRT State codes and allowing residents the ability to bill for SBIRT activities were cited as challenges to implementation in practice at one program.<b></b></li>
              <li>In another State, SBIRT billing codes do exist for SBIRT and are in the EMR system, but SBIRT services are not being billed for. Facility compliance departments often require additional language in the progress notes to support billing.</li>
              <li>Although departmental faculty members at one program recognize the importance and rationale for better integrating SBIRT into clinical practice, the medical directors are operating in a fiscally constrained environment that cannot easily take on new initiatives.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The referral-to-treatment component of SBIRT is a challenge in many cases:
            <ul>
              <li>The current public substance abuse treatment system is often difficult to access, particularly because of limited resources for indigent patients and challenges with accessing services for patients with co-occurring substance use and mental disorders.</li>
              <li>One program has developed community referral resources; however, referral to treatment continues as one of its highest need areas. </li>
              <li>The SBIRT training and practice in many clinic settings do not focus on actively connecting patients to referral services. </li>
              <li>Specialty community-based alcohol and substance abuse referral resources are in short supply, especially age-appropriate services for adolescents referred from the pediatric department.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Cultural competency is a challenge at sites serving highly diverse populations. At one program, residents find it difficult to engage in conversations on substance use with non-English-speaking patients. Although they frequently use language interpreters, residents tend to feel they are not part of the conversation or that certain nuanced meanings are not conveyed accurately. To improve cultural awareness and better understand the medical and psychosocial needs among its diverse patient population, the program developed a panel discussion that focused on targeted populations (e.g., women, Latino families, Asian Americans, and those participating in a mobile methadone van program). The discussion was highly relevant and engaging, and program staff members will continue such panel presentations in the future.</li>
          <li>Geographical diversity is both an asset and a challenge for one grantee. Although SBIRT&rsquo;s presence is far reaching, sites are spread over great distances across the State, and not all programs are familiar with one another&rsquo;s activities. </li>
          <li>Workflow issues are occasionally reported. At one program, integrating SBIRT activities into the routine workflow is clearly defined in some settings and less clearly defined in others. For example, highly defined processes at a homeless shelter may not be possible, given the outreach nature of the setting and the population&rsquo;s high level of need. Another program has found it challenging, at a systems clinic level, to get a routine SBIRT procedure implemented.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">DISSEMINATION</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Many programs are successfully achieving dissemination goals (i.e., identifying early adopters of innovation) by training across hospital departments and provider types and in local and statewide communities. </li>
          <li>Many curricula have been disseminated beyond the original residency departments and are now well integrated into other departments. Interest from key stakeholders in other departmental residency programs has developed and may pave the way for abbreviated SBIRT training to be included on their schedules.</li>
          <li>Some grantees have expanded training opportunities and discussions on SBIRT and addiction medicine to include third-year medical students, nurses and nursing students, medical assistants, physical therapists, and nonmedical support staff, such as social workers.</li>
          <li>Some grantees have obtained continuing medical education (CME) credits for their SBIRT training programs.</li>
          <li>Grantees encourage program faculty, staff, and residents to develop scholarly papers, abstracts, posters, and presentations. Several have already been developed and delivered at State professional meetings, as well as nationally and internationally. </li>
          <li>Grantees have received visits from high-level Federal staff, such as the Office of National Drug Control Policy director.</li>
          <li>Several specific grantee dissemination efforts are unique and noteworthy:
            <ul>
              <li>One grantee is disseminating its pediatric curriculum to other SBIRT medical residency grantees and to the larger medical community. Because few other SBIRT medical residency training curricula address substance use among adolescents, this curriculum can offer a unique contribution to other SBIRT programs.</li>
              <li>One grantee has conducted nurse trainings for three community health agencies in a neighboring county and provided training or material to the local Veterans Administration, the State department of health, and an associated medical school. At the time of the site visit, it was planning to train 10 hospitals in another State in May 2011.</li>
              <li>One program trains <em>promotores</em> working with non-English-speaking migrant laborers and medical residents to conduct outreach on a variety of health topics, including SBIRT. The program is working to further disseminate SBIRT in community-based adolescent programs and the drug court.</li>
              <li>Staff at one program have successfully used the SBIRT initiative to catalyze several other initiatives supporting better integration of addictions services and behavioral health within primary care.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Productive collaborations have been developed between medical residency programs and other SBIRT grantees, outside organizations, and State agencies. Education coordinators at some programs are developing collaboration plans to work with outside organizations to train them in SBIRT and motivational interviewing, to develop and disseminate SBIRT training and materials (including Web-based tools and training videos), and to provide or obtain technical assistance for Web accessibility of training modules. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Grantee staff and faculty continue to show commitment to developing innovative technological solutions for prescreening, assessment, and brief intervention scripting.</li>
          <li>SBIRT screening tools have been incorporated to varying degrees into the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of many grantees: 
            <ul>
              <li>Some programs are still in early stages of integration and have hired outside organizations to help. </li>
              <li>In some cases, SBIRT has been integrated into the EMR system of the inpatient setting and is scheduled to be implanted into all EMRs of outpatient services. </li>
              <li>One grantee has incorporated SBIRT into EMRs only where possible and otherwise uses paper-based records.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Grantees continue to add new tools (e.g., the Drug Abuse Screening Test [DAST]) to their EMRs and to update existing ones to reflect new evidence.</li>
          <li>EMR technology will support more timely and consistent delivery of services, improved collaborative care, and consistent documentation. </li>
          <li>Some grantees have developed Web sites that provide a virtual learning environment for the medical residency program. These sites house many components: the training curriculum, curricular materials and slides, alcohol and drug screening forms, role-playing and practice cases, demonstration videos, quizzes, information on reimbursement, motivational interviewing strategies, alcohol and drug fact sheets, surveys, screening tools and evaluation instruments, research, journal articles and scholarly papers, Internet links, and additional resources that address drug, alcohol, tobacco, and opioid abuse. One grantee even developed a free, searchable online directory of local and major national resources. The directory provides not only contact information, but also descriptions of program philosophy, services, target populations, and fee structures. Below are links to some of the sites developed by grantees:

          </li>
          <li>Other innovative technology solutions include the following examples: 
            <ul>
              <li>One grantee&rsquo;s use of computers on wheels in its emergency department has been beneficial to reducing staff time required to perform SBIRT activities.</li>
              <li>One grantee developed an SBIRT smart set to facilitate data entry for patients&rsquo; Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and DAST scores, brief intervention information, physician notes, billing information, and prescription notes. The SBIRT smart set is an essential part of an SBIRT business practice model, increases buy-in, and helps monitor fidelity to the SBIRT model.</li>
              <li>One grantee is implementing an iPad pilot project: all pediatric residents will receive an iPad preloaded with reminders, algorithms, and forms for easy access to SBIRT information and other pediatric training materials and resources.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>SBIRT data input and extraction are limited for a few grantees because of their current EMR systems&rsquo; capacities and tools. Examples include the following:
            <ul>
              <li>At one program, an SBIRT intervention might be completed in the clinic, but it might not be fully recorded in the EMR.</li>
              <li>At another program, where efforts to incorporate SBIRT into EMRs are still ongoing, residents are encouraged to screen every patient (using the AUDIT-C, DAST, CRAFFT, or TWEAK, as appropriate), but the patient&rsquo;s chart has no mechanism to document whether a screen has been administered or whether the patient has received a brief intervention (if warranted by a positive screening result). </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The EpicEMR system, in particular, has posed challenges to several grantees: 
            <ul>
              <li>One grantee reports that the screening questions currently in Epic cannot be modified until other system priorities are addressed. </li>
              <li>Another grantee reports that although the system offers a means for documenting SBIRT delivery in clinical encounters, Epic&rsquo;s social history portion is nonadjustable. Thus, the SBIRT screening component cannot be incorporated, must be integrated as a separate module, creates extra steps for physician documentation, and interferes with physician workflow. </li>
              <li>One grantee has residents who rotate through roughly 12 hospitals. Some of those hospitals are not using an EMR system or are using a system that does not communicate with Epic. These interoperability issues can affect information sharing, coordination of patient care, data collection for evaluating SBIRT delivery, and the utility and value of Epic. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Some grantee staff find it challenging to work successfully with their information technology departments—a hurdle for transitioning to new EMR systems and integrating SBIRT elements into systems.</li>
          <li>Several grantees are reporting challenges with the online Blackboard system, a self-directed learning component of the SBIRT curriculum with modules that include SBIRT-related presentations, mastery quizzes, and readings. Staff at one program report that module duration is an issue, and they would like to make Blackboard a more interactive learning component. Another program cites Blackboard&rsquo;s limited tracking capability. For example, the SBIRT program evaluation staff use a burdensome process to manually transfer Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) responses into the Service Accountability Improvement System (SAIS) and to determine whether a resident completed a training module, thus impeding the tracking of resident and departmental training progress. </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Most medical residency training programs have designed and implemented mechanisms to support program sustainability, including embedding SBIRT into routine residency practice sites, integrating SBIRT into the EMR system, and developing Web-based training capacity.</li>
          <li>Impressive buy-in from management, physicians, and program staff lends itself to the sustainability of most SBIRT medical residency programs in their communities.</li>
          <li>Comprehensive dissemination plans are generally viewed by program faculty as an essential component of their sustainability plan.</li>
          <li>Multiple champions within departments assist in normalizing SBIRT in their respective curricula and increase the likelihood of continuing SBIRT as a sustainable practice once the grants end.</li>
          <li>Most grantees are well connected in their institutions, have strong networking practices, and have successfully collaborated with State agencies, further ensuring sustainability.</li>
          <li>Grantees generally plan to maintain their SBIRT training components, and most have tailored their training programs to the unique contexts of various residency programs. For example, at one program, the SBIRT overview and motivational interviewing modules have been incorporated into the adolescent medicine residency syllabus, and the attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) module is incorporated into the developmental medicine residency syllabus. Each module will continue to be taught beyond the life of the grant, and other modules will be offered in an electronic format in the future.</li>
          <li>Many programs have created new SBIRT training manuals and developed new standardized and specialty-specific patient scenarios that can serve as a legacy to be passed on to sustain SBIRT beyond the life of their grants.</li>
          <li>Many programs are building significant capacity within faculty to train and support SBIRT. Programs that have physician implementation models with a phased train-the-trainer approach are particularly well positioned to prepare faculty and resident champions to assume complete responsibility for sustaining their SBIRT programs.</li>
          <li>Many grantees have been training allied health staff and nonmedical clinicians as part of their program&rsquo;s plan for sustaining SBIRT after grant funding ends. For example, one grantee is in the process of developing a training program for hospital social workers. </li>
          <li>Some programs use simulation centers and staff that are supported by funds outside their grants, making standardized patients a sustainable resource after their grants end.</li>
          <li>In some States, Medicaid billing codes for SBIRT have been activated for third-party payers. One grantee is working on a pilot study to determine whether activating the Medicaid SBIRT-associated codes can result in cost savings to its State.</li>
        </ul>
      <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Despite their connections, networks, and collaborations, a handful of grantees lack formal sustainability plans.</li>
          <li>Several grantees report billing, reimbursement, and other financial challenges: 
            <ul>
              <li>At one program, reimbursement for SBIRT is generally considered to be too low to make billing worthwhile in some departments. The processes and procedures for billing differ across departments, and incorporating a new service can be a complicated, time-intensive process. </li>
              <li>Another grantee reports that although accountable care organizations and patient-centered medical homes are understood and supported as important innovations in health care delivery, reimbursement systems have lagged behind these initiatives, creating challenges with implementation and sustainability.</li>
              <li>SBIRT billing codes have not been activated in some States.</li>
              <li>Although other States, such as Connecticut and Pennsylvania, have activated SBIRT billing codes, institutions are not currently billing for services because the rates are so low that reimbursement would not offset staff time costs for billing.</li>
              <li>Budget cuts in some States, such as California and Texas, affect access to health services, particularly the number of resources available to patients who are referred to treatment.</li>
              <li>Some programs are concerned that under the Uniform Policy Provision Law patients might not receive reimbursement for costs incurred when an accident is a result of the insured patient&rsquo;s alcohol or substance use intoxication.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Maintaining faculty interest and participation in the program after the grant expires will be a challenge to many grantees for several reasons: 
            <ul>
              <li>At some programs, a portion of the faculty champions&rsquo; salaries are supported by the grant. This funding will not be available after the grant expires. </li>
              <li>SBIRT is one of many competing priorities within the already busy schedules of residency training programs.</li>
              <li>Many trained residents will finish their programs and might begin practice in settings with little knowledge of SBIRT and substance abuse. Programs are concerned about residents sustaining their skills in environments that do not provide support and ongoing feedback.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Limited addiction referral resources in some areas are potential barriers to residents and attending physicians who would like to screen patients for substance abuse but hesitate to do so because of the limited options for those who need treatment.</li>
          <li>One program has insufficient funding for a project important to its SBIRT sustainability efforts: development of a Web-based brief negotiated interview (BNI) virtual coach—a Web-based interactive application that provides users with case scenarios where BNI skills are applied and real-time feedback on the intervention. The SBIRT program staff are attempting to identify funding sources for the virtual coach.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Many medical residency programs have robust and comprehensive evaluation components and use multiple data collection strategies to enhance validity, including the following examples:
            <ul>
              <li>Grantees generally evaluate process, curriculum development outcome, curriculum effectiveness, and dissemination effectiveness.</li>
              <li>Many grantees include long-term outcome-level data.</li>
              <li>Grantees often assess the training satisfaction of residents and champions.</li>
              <li>Curriculum effectiveness is often measured using standardized patient pre- and post-assessments.</li>
              <li>Some grantees collect information on implementation trends of SBIRT services, which could be prepared for submission to peer-reviewed journals.</li>
              <li>Evaluation components are often captured across all sites, including measuring changes in resident knowledge and skills, direct observation, supervisory rating, use of an SBIRT proficiency checklist, and assessing use of motivational interviewing and Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) measures.</li>
              <li>At least one grantee has a qualitative evaluation component, allowing for narrative reflection. One program is developing a qualitative instrument to assess learner feedback on SBIRT curriculum and implementation practices in clinical settings.</li>
              <li>Another grantee has developed a proficiency checklist to gauge resident skill based on direct observation of residents in practice settings.</li>
              <li>One grantee measures competency and proficiency using the Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX) and is exploring further development in this area.</li>
              <li>At one program, patients provide an indirect assessment of provider practices via an annual anonymous waiting room survey. </li>
              <li>One evaluation team has exceeded evaluation requirements by embarking on a large-scale chart review effort to measure patient outcomes.</li>
              <li>One program&rsquo;s evaluation instruments incorporate the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Perception Questionnaire and the Drug and Drug Use Problems Perception Questionnaire.</li>
              <li>Data collection instruments can generally be completed online.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Evaluation appears to be used as a program improvement tool to guide adjustments as needed.</li>
          <li>Programs tend to continuously assesses performance through process and outcome measures that gauge the knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of residents and faculty toward SBIRT specifically and substance use disorders more generally. </li>
          <li>Many programjects have disseminated lessons learned about their evaluation experiences via presentations at the local and national levels.</li>
          <li>Faculty trainers have successfully demonstrated the generalizability of patient-centered communication skills to facilitate behavior change with their patients not only on substance use but also on a broader spectrum of clinical issues (e.g., medicine adherence, lifestyle changes with regard to diabetes, and hypertension).</li>
          <li>Many evaluations have produced results that demonstrate successful SBIRT training and implementation, as in the following findings:
            <ul>
              <li>At one program, at followup, 83 percent of the trainees indicated that they had applied what they had learned in their work.</li>
              <li>At another program, even though residents&rsquo; satisfaction with SBIRT appeared to decrease after 30 days, the majority of residents continued to agree that they were satisfied with the training.</li>
              <li>One program tracked more than 2,000 patient encounters.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b><br />
      As the following examples show, the various evaluation challenges reported are program specific and cannot be generalized across programs:  </p>
        <ul>
          <li>At one program, the project director leads and manages chart audits, including training health center staff and residents to identify patients needing an annual screening. This process should be reviewed, because the current approach is not sustainable over the long term. </li>
          <li>One program evaluator has a limited presence in the program.</li>
          <li>Staff members at one program are strained in personnel available to satisfy all of the evaluation components the program would like to accomplish.</li>
          <li>The numbers of residents surveyed to date at one of the programs is relatively small (n=32).</li>
          <li>Internal medicine residents at one program are on an alternating 2-months-on/2-months-off ambulatory block schedule. This schedule has a potential negative impact on 30-day GPRA followup rates, as residents become difficult to track during the second half of their rotation, when they are immersed back in the hospital wards. Web-based surveying has improved both GPRA and resident survey response rates. Similar issues for tracking faculty responses arose at that program, and data collection procedures will be modified.</li>
          <li>Another program has found it challenging to get residents to complete GPRA followup and other local evaluation reports. Followup rates at 12 and 24 months continue to be relatively low. </li>
          <li>Tracking residents from other program areas and those who may have already left the program continues to pose a challenge for at least one grantee. </li>
          <li>At baseline, many residents at one program are reluctant to participate in learning about substance use and may lack the confidence in their ability to address and treat related disorders. Evaluators found that residents who ranked discomfort and lack of experience as barriers when screening or treating patients for substance abuse were less confident in their ability to engage in SBIRT.</li>
          <li>Evaluators at one program found it challenging to evaluate SBIRT across specialties, especially when various departments adapted the core curriculum to fit their specialty areas and have incorporated SBIRT into their curricula in differing ways (e.g., Web based, lectures, and inpatient/outpatient rotations). Evaluators hope to aggregate the first year&rsquo;s findings to inform processes better.</li>
          <li>One program would like to (1) verify that the residents are actually screening and performing real-time brief interventions in the family health centers and (2) understand how the residents are using screenings and brief interventions in the patient population.</li>
          <li>Staff at one program described difficulty determining the full extent to which residents are performing BNIs with patients. The number of screenings and BNIs performed by residents appears inconsistent with the number of BNIs being logged in EMRs.</li>
          <li>Getting residents to document an accurate count of the screenings and brief interventions they are performing is challenging at one program. This challenge is exacerbated in the shift to the Epic system from the current EMR system.</li>
        </ul>
