    <h3 class="accordion-header">Population Served</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul>
          <li>The South Carolina population is geographically dispersed. Nearly 75 percent is designated as rural, and at least some portion of all but two of the State&rsquo;s counties are medically underserved (SCORH, 2013). </li>
          <li>Approximately 7 percent of South Carolina adult residents are estimated to be dependent on alcohol, 7 percent dependent on marijuana, and 12 percent dependent on cocaine (Kandel et al., 1997). </li>
          <li>RCP graduates work with transition-age and adult persons with physical and/or psychiatric disabilities, person with serious and long-term mental illnesses and/or co-occurring disorders (mental illness and substance abuse), and students with learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, and/or other disabilities.</li>
          <li>NPSY residents encounter substance use patients on the majority of their rotations. They serve persons with serious mental illness or mental conditions—who are 61 percent more likely to abuse alcohol, 115 percent more likely to abuse illicit drugs<em>, </em>and 287 percent more likely to be dependent on illicit drugs than are other persons (Brucker, 2007).</li>
          <li>The resident ambulatory clinic population served by INTM residents is all adult, predominantly low income with only Medicaid insurance, and more than 50 percent black.</li>
        </ul>
