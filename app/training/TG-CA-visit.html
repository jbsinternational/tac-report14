            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The council of directors is composed mainly of staff directly involved in the project. </li>
              <li>The project coordinator works at only at 12 percent full-time equivalent (FTE). </li>
              <li>Management of the program lacks accountability and standardized processes.</li>
      <li>There is little buy-in from some members of the council of directors</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Integrated substance abuse programs team trainers are experienced and competent. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Faculty are not conducting trainings, although there are plans to have nursing and social work faculty take up training responsibilities in subsequent years. </li>
      <li>The training targets may be unrealistic.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">COMMUNITY LINKAGES, PARTNERS, AND PARTICIPATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strength</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The grantee plans to host a large SBIRT conference in August 2014 that will highlight the program and involve community members.</li>
              <li>The grantee has proposed an interactive site through which the community can access SBIRT information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
      <li>The SBIRT Web site and conference will take much planning and work.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strength</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Nursing and social work students will have an opportunity to practice SBIRT skills in the classroom.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clinical practicums are taking place in a wide range of institutions, most of which do not implement SBIRT.</li>
      <li>LA SBIRT has little control over the preceptors, and it will be challenging to motivate them to embrace SBIRT.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">AFFORDABLE CARE ACT READINESS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strength</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>LA SBIRT is filling a gap in nursing education by training students to integrate behavioral health prevention activities in medical settings. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenge</b></p>
            <ul>
      <li>None noted.</li></ul></div>

            <li>No plan for long-term sustainability has been put forward. </li>
          </ul>
      </div>
    
     <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strength</b></p>
          <ul>

          </ul>
          <p><b>Challenge</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contacting students for followup can be challenging. </li>

        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <h3 class="accordion-header">RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Grantee-Led Enhancements</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Program Vision and Design
            <ul>
              <li>Consider laying out a &ldquo;playbook&rdquo; that outlines exactly what will be taught, by whom, and in what course.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Grantee Leadership
            <ul>
              <li>Consider creating a more diverse council of directors by recruiting members from outside the grant. It would be helpful to have representatives from clinics and hospitals where students do their clinical work. </li>
              <li>Increase the project coordinator&rsquo;s time to 80–100 percent FTE.</li>
              <li>Develop an organizational structure with clear lines of reporting and defined roles. </li>
              <li>Create SMART goals for the project and the council of directors.</li>
              <li>Consider creating buy-in by conducting a stakeholder needs assessment. The executive committee could distribute a survey among stakeholders asking about their motivation to incorporate SBIRT into their institutions or educational programs. They could then base outreach activities on the results.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation
            <ul>
              <li>Consider creating a timeline for the Web site and advertising a launch to increase interest.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Experiential Learning
            <ul>
              <li>Consider finding a champion at a hospital or clinic that trains a large number of students. If possible, this champion would be a decisionmaker in the institution who could advocate for routine SBIRT implementation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Sustainability Planning
            <ul>
              <li>Consider branding the SBIRT program, including creating a logo. It is important the students and faculty feel they are a part of something exciting, new, and interesting. Consider holding a logo contest to create interest in the program, especially from students.</li>
              <li>Have the executive committee consider working with the council of directors to lay out a clear plan with faculty that addresses how SBIRT will be implemented, evaluated, and sustained when grant funding ends.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Grantee Evaluation
            <ul>
              <li>Consider distributing the 1-year survey online through a platform such as Survey Monkey, collecting as much contact data from students as possible so they will be easier to follow after graduation.</li>
              <li>Consider developing a proficiency checklist or using one that has already been developed and tested (e.g., the checklist created by the University of Pittsburgh). This checklist could be used to code and assess proficiency in role-plays or interactions with standardized patients. If preceptors are amenable to the idea, they could also use the checklist to assess students&rsquo; interactions with real patients in clinical settings.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Potential Technical Assistance Requests</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implementation Plan
            <ul>
              <li>As requested, obtain technical assistance to create individual online modules or adapt modules created by another program. </li>
              <li>Consider conducting monthly check-in calls with the Government Project Officer (GPO). A few implementation issues that might require immediate attention from the GPO are lowering training targets and increasing funding for the project coordinator position.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation
            <ul>
              <li>Consider inviting a high-profile speaker to draw people to the SBIRT conference and providing interactive workshops where participants can practice SBIRT skills.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Experiential Learning
            <ul>
              <li>Provide preceptor training, which is critical to the experiential learning process. Preceptors may be trained through an online module; the more difficult the preceptors are to reach, the shorter and more streamlined the training should be.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
