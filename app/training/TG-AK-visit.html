        <h3 class="accordion-header">PROGRAM VISION AND DESIGN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The project takes a multidisciplinary approach to the implementation of SBIRT and has obtained buy-in from the various participating disciplines.</li>
              <li>With input from faculty and administrative staff from each discipline, the grantee has developed curriculum content, case studies, and simulation activities specific to each discipline and has customized the content to account for practice considerations specific to Alaska.</li>

            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE LEADERSHIP</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The core grantee staff and university faculty and leadership are committed to incorporating SBIRT in their academic programs. The staff are engaged in a continuous improvement process and are open to making changes to their training and implementation approach.</li>
                <li>The grantee&rsquo;s council of directors is composed of representatives from each participating discipline, a project director from a successful SAMHSA SBIRT medical residency grantee, and key State policy and health care partners who seem invested in the success of the project. </li>
                
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The council of directors plans to meet two to three times per year, posing potential challenges in communicating and obtaining feedback on process and content improvements.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</b>
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The project&rsquo;s initial implementation strategy to pilot-test the training curriculum allowed for content modifications and process improvements to be made prior to full implementation. This &ldquo;plan, do, study, act&rdquo; model, a quality control methodology designed to temporarily implement a change and assess its impact, will be used throughout the grant cycle.</li>
              <li>The SBIRT curriculum has been integrated into required courses and/or required training experiences for three of the four disciplines participating in the project.</li>
              <li>The grantee uses the university&rsquo;s Interprofessional Health Science Simulation Center to provide students and residents with immersive, high-fidelity, culturally appropriate simulation experiences.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
          <ul>
              <li>While grantee staff and some faculty received an introductory training on SBIRT and an overview of the curriculum, a more comprehensive training is needed to make staff and faculty confident in their ability to deliver and teach the SBIRT intervention. </li>
      <li>The experiential component of the SBIRT training has not been completed for social work students.</li></ul></div>
