        <h3 class="accordion-header">PROGRAM VISION AND DESIGN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The focus on nursing has the potential to dramatically increase the reach of SBIRT by developing &ldquo;SBIRT-ready&rdquo; bachelor of science in nursing (B.S.N.) students who will be able to support systemic implementation when and where that happens and master&rsquo;s-level Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) students who are destined for larger roles as primary care providers and agents of change in their clinical venues.</li>
              <li>The elements of SBIRT are integrated into the full spectrum of courses throughout the B.S.N. curriculum and in key coursework in the APRN curriculum. </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>While weaving SBIRT throughout the curriculum can be seen as a strength, it also may come with challenges, such as lack of a cohesive and holistic view of SBIRT.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE LEADERSHIP</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The grantee has a strong and motivated group of leaders and champions within the University of Colorado College of Nurses (CU CON).</li>
              <li>Including Brie Reimann and Leigh Fisher from SBIRT Colorado brings strong support.</li>
              <li>The council of directors has been formed and is already expanding SBIRT in the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Most of council of directors members are part of CU CON or work at UCH. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Nurses Helping Colorado (NHC) has worked hard to promote SBIRT and get buy-in from faculty and staff within CU CON and at practice sites.</li>
              <li>NHC has tailored the SBIRT core curriculum to be more relevant to nurses and has created nurse-focused role-play scenarios.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>NHC still finds students need more nurse-centered SBIRT materials. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">COMMUNITY LINKAGES, PARTNERS, AND PARTICIPATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>NHC has developed strong partnerships with most of the important service providers in the area.</li>
              <li>NHC is part of an independent group that includes, among others, SBIRT Colorado and Dr. Paul Seale. This group is attempting to build a community of practice around SBIRT and nursing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The program is by nature nurse-centric. While nurses surely are an innovative and important group of providers to train, NHC must continue to take steps to avoid becoming insular. </li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</b>
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sheridan Federally Qualified Health Center and Denver Health are models of experiential learning, and they have made SBIRT part of their routine service provision.</li>
              <li>CU CON has created a strong practicum program.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
          <ul>
              <li>There is a lack of buy-in from preceptors.</li>
                <li>Most clinical practice sites where students follow their courses of study are not implementing SBIRT routinely. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">AFFORDABLE CARE ACT READINESS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>CU CON is preparing students to use electronic health records.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The EPIC electronic health record system at UCH includes SBIRT questions, but most providers are not asking them. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Embedding SBIRT content into all CU CON curricula should facilitate sustainability. </li>
              <li>NHC is creating scenarios for role-plays and would like to create a workbook.        </li>
          </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The NHC Web site is not linked to the broader CU Web site.        </li>
          </ul>
      </div>


 <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Strengths</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>NHC has created a strong conceptual framework for evaluating the program. </li>
              <li>NHC is being thoughtful and deliberate in crafting its evaluation methodology.</li>
          </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Knowledge, skills, and attitudes are not being captured.</li>
              <li>Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) data collection timeframes have presented a problem because content is woven through the B.S.N. program and integrated into selected APRN courses. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
