        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Program directors, Dr. Christopher Welsh and Dr. Carlo DiClemente, have significant experience in research, education, and training involving substance abuse treatment in clinical practice (especially brief intervention and motivational interviewing).</li>
              <li>The University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) has operated grants that involve applying screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) components or principles in clinical settings (e.g., R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center) and is part of an extensive network of hospitals and other clinical practice sites that have state-of-the-art practice facilities for training (e.g., COMPACT Center for observing simulated resident–patient clinical encounters).</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The program team is committed to providing a consistent core curriculum to a diverse group of residents. To achieve this goal, it has developed methods for training that are flexible and adaptive to unique residency program needs. </li>
              <li>The SBIRT curriculum was designed to be delivered in various methods, including slide presentations and didactic lectures, training videos, and role-playing exercises resulting in dynamic trainings that improve resident knowledge and skill development. </li>
              <li>The program team is also developing online modules (expected to be completed in summer 2011) that will allow residents to access SBIRT training content remotely at their convenience. </li>
              <li>The SBIRT curriculum will provide full, abbreviated, and Web-based versions to broaden the scope of residents who receive training. This approach captures residents whose rotation schedule permits them to participate in the full-length training as well as residents who can participate only through the abbreviated or Web-based versions (e.g., residents who rotate through the Shock Trauma Center may have only a 1-month window to be trained). </li>
              <li>The core curriculum provides a standard knowledge base and skill set to be taught across specialty programs. In addition, the curriculum has an adaptation component uniquely designed for each specialty program area that addresses the particular considerations of that practice setting and patient population. For example, obstetrics/gynecology residents review trend data in substance use and abuse among pregnant women and practice SBIRT techniques through role-playing using scenarios representative of doctor–patient interactions in an obstetrics/gynecology clinical setting.</li>
              <li>The curriculum will continue to evolve as more specialty areas are trained.</li>
              <li>The curriculum will be customized based on specialty area because of issues related to scheduling, availability of time, patient characteristics, practice setting, and workflow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The program team has acknowledged a lack of evidence to support the efficacy of online modules as a mode of residency training; however, the use of online modules is used in similar programs and may circumvent some of the limitations in onsite availability for first-year residents imposed by new limits on consecutive duty hours.</li>
              <li>Variability across the seven targeted residency program areas (e.g., content area, patient characteristics, practice setting, and workflow) may act as a barrier to standardization. The core curriculum provides a basic knowledge and skill set across all program areas, and the adaptation component is intended to provide the flexibility to target SBIRT training and education material to the unique needs and considerations of a given residency program. However, program area variability may result in significant differences in curriculum, training design, and delivery that may cause challenges in grants management, evaluation, and other areas. For example, residents are taught about screening instruments, but not all are being trained to use them nor are they using them as according to the evidence base. </li>
              <li>The application of overall concepts in screening and brief interventions is encouraged, but because of the settings and time constraints residents are not necessarily taught to adhere to specific evidence-based protocols.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The program has developed an MD3 pocket card for clinicians to use in their practice/interactions with patience. The pocket card is a resource for medical students, medical residents, attending physicians, and other health care professionals. It contains valuable information on SBIRT for patients misusing tobacco, alcohol, and drugs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>As of July 1, 2011, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) reduced caps on consecutive duty hours for first-year medical residents from 24 hours to 16 hours, with some exceptions. In the past, medical residency programs have depended on residents working long shifts for training and education purposes. The greater amount of time residents are onsite, the greater the opportunity for integrating education and training into their shift and the easier it is to schedule and coordinate education and training sessions with the greatest number of residents. With new reductions in duty hours, UMMC, as well as other medical residency grantees, will need to devise ways to deal with greater variation in residents&rsquo; schedules and the fewer hours available to deliver SBIRT training and education as planned.</li>
              <li>Currently, residents are not asked to administer a specific validated instrument. Rather, they learn about the instruments and screening questions, a practice that often leads to item selection, modification, and the creation and use of an adapted tool.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The EPIC electronic medical record (EMR) system contains a module for documenting SBIRT&rsquo;s prescreening component during a clinical encounter. EPIC may be leveraged for documenting delivery of other SBIRT components and for evaluation purposes. </li>
              <li>EMR technology offers UMMC the ability to document SBIRT delivery across clinical settings in a standardized way. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The EPIC EMR system, although offering a means for documenting SBIRT delivery in clinical encounters, has limitations. For example, the social history portion of EPIC is nonadjustable. Thus, the SBIRT screening component cannot be incorporated and must be integrated as a separate module. This may create extra steps for physician documentation and interfere with physician workflow. </li>
              <li>Residents rotate through roughly 12 hospitals, and some are not using an EMR system or are using a system that does not communicate with EPIC. These interoperability issues can affect information sharing, coordination of patient care, data collection for evaluating SBIRT delivery, and the utility and value of EPIC. </li>
            </ul>
