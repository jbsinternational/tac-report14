          <li>UCPC residents see patients at 2 urban clinics (Parnassus and Mount Zion) with more than 55,000 visits per year. The patients served reflect the ethnic and economic diversity of San Francisco: approximately 9 percent are Latino, 12 percent are African American, 22 percent are Asian/Pacific Islander, 46 percent are White, and 11 percent are &ldquo;other&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>Insurance coverage is also diverse: 57 percent of patients have commercial contracted care, 28 percent have Medicare, 11 percent have MediCal (i.e., Medicaid), and 3 percent are self-pay. </li>
          <li>The Parnassus clinic mostly serves medically disabled, elderly, working poor, and middle-class patients with serious medical comorbidities. </li>
          <li>The Mount Zion clinic, located between robust African American and Asian communities, serves lower to middle-income patients, including large groups of African American and Asian American older adults.</li>
