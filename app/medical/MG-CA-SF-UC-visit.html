        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE LEADERSHIP</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) medical residency program includes faculty with a wealth of expertise in addiction medicine. Steve Batki, M.D., is an addiction psychiatrist with UCSF based at the San Francisco VA  Medical Center. Dr. Batki has expertise in opioids, methadone, and pharmacotherapy. He provides consultation for faculty training and includes an SBIRT component in his addiction pharmacotherapy course. </li>
              <li>Elinore McCance-Katz, Ph.D., is an addictions psychiatrist with a doctorate in neuropharmacology based at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). Dr. McCance-Katz who is based at SFGH, helps guide the clinical support system for buprenorphine and consults with UCSF SBIRT faculty, offering expertise in pharmacotherapy, prescription drug abuse, and opioid issues.</li>
              <li>The UCSF medical residency program had a strong focus in mental and behavioral health care before the SAMHSA SBIRT grant. Behavioral health seminars were previously conducted for primary care residents. Because primary care residents were already allotted time to spend on mental and behavioral health care, pushback from primary care faculty for SBIRT training was not significant. In addition, a mental health tool (i.e., depression screener) and related support systems were already in place, and staff and patient familiarity with them aided the grantee in making the SBIRT screener part of the process in UCSF clinics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header"> CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The UCSF SBIRT medical residency program has developed a strong, comprehensive curriculum for primary care residents during the first year of the funding period. This curriculum will be used as a template to be adapted for other medical residency programs for years 2–5.</li>
              <li>The primary care training includes 10 hours of training (five 2-hour seminars). These interactive seminars include didactic presentations, standardized patient scenarios, interstation exercises, video clips, role-playing exercises, case studies, discussions, and debriefings.</li>
              <li>Multilevel faculty SBIRT training for preceptors and trainers is a core component of the design.</li>
              <li>All SBIRT faculty and preceptors complete one of two training paths: expert or general preceptor training. Standardized training ensures a consistent level of expertise across faculty.</li>
              <li>SBIRT faculty and preceptors for primary care residents are expected to complete an 8-hour self- directed curriculum on 13 different topic areas, a 4-hour intensive SBIRT workshop, and a 4-hour case consultation with addiction medicine experts as part of a train-the-trainer course. </li>
              <li>The program has developed three standardized patient scenarios that are used in the clinical skills lab for pre- and post-assessments. A checklist, requiring 8 hours of actor training time to use, is employed for assessment. Staff have expressed willingness to share the scenarios with other grantees, perhaps via the MedEdPortal.</li>
              <li>The Kanbar Clinical Skills Center opened on the UCSF campus in January 2011. The center includes technology-enhanced classrooms, electronic commons, telemedicine centers, simulation centers, and 12 standardized patient rooms. All encounters can be videotaped and reviewed with a preceptor. </li>
              <li>As the UCSF SBIRT program prepares to expand to other specialty areas, faculty training will continue to be conducted. A faculty needs assessment will be completed for each department implementing SBIRT so that the train-the-trainer content can be adapted to meet faculty needs.</li>
              <li>The UCSF medical residency program has adapted its curriculum and materials to respond to the eclectic demographics of San Francisco and the patients that UCSF staff serve. The SBIRT screener was translated into both Spanish and Chinese. A Russian interpreter also is available.</li>
              <li>UCSF and SFGH collaborate to offer buprenorphine training for residents and faculty to improve physician capacity for office-based buprenorphine treatment. Physicians must complete 8 hours of training in addictions treatment and use of buprenorphine to receive Food and Drug Administration approval to prescribe. The SBIRT grant supported the development of a 4-hour self-directed course and a 4-hour face-to-face local mentor program to enhance the abilities of residents and faculty to obtain buprenorphine waivers and to increase the number of locally prescribing physicians in the community. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The grantee has a three-part approach to SBIRT implementation: (1) residency training, (2) faculty training, and (3) systems changes. The systems changes are made throughout the program to facilitate sustainability after grant funding ends.</li>
              <li>The UCSF SBIRT medical residency program&rsquo;s implementation model is designed to be flexible in adapting its curriculum to diverse residency programs. UCSF initially implemented SBIRT training for primary care faculty and residents with a comprehensive &ldquo;Cadillac&rdquo; curriculum. Years 2–5 of the SAMHSA grant will be spent tailoring the primary care curriculum to meet the needs of specialty residency areas that have different focus areas and less time available for SBIRT training.</li>
              <li>The grantee focuses on collaboration with other health entities. Staff share resources and materials with SFGH, which also has an SBIRT grant from SAMHSA. UCSF and SFGH conduct joint trainings for SBIRT faculty, buprenorphine training for residents and faculty, and San Francisco TeleMedicine workshops. The two grantees also share data evaluation techniques to avoid redundancy in material development and to produce complementary measurement tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Program implementation was interrupted when the clinic relocated in December 2010.</li>
              <li>The SBIRT program coordinator position was unfilled until recently. </li>
              <li>These logistical challenges resulted in difficulty developing a standardized SBIRT process and required program adaptation and flexibility. Nevertheless, the program has met its targets for the 18 months of the grant. </li>
              <li>The grantee has been unable to identify a validated prescription drug abuse screener. Prescription drug abuse makes up a large proportion of substance abuse issues in the patient population. The lack of a standardized screener for prescription drug abuse produces difficulties in effectively assessing these patients.</li>
              <li>In years 2–5, the program plans to expand training to other specialty areas. The program is dealing with gaining buy-in from different specialty areas and adapting the curriculum to meet the educational needs and reduced time available for SBIRT training among specialty residents.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">DISSEMINATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The grantee collaborates with outside agencies to disseminate SBIRT training and materials. </li>
              <li>UCSF SBIRT has conducted nurse trainings for three community health agencies in Marin County and provided training or material to the Veterans Administration, the State Department of Health, and the UCSF medical school. </li>
              <li>UCSF was scheduled to train10 hospitals in Maryland in May 2011.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>A new electronic medical record (EMR) system was implemented in April 2011.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Implementation of the new EMR system resulted in loss of faculty time to conduct new system training.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Kanbar facility and staff are supported by an endowment from UCSF, not by grant funds, making the facility a sustainable resource for the UCSF SBIRT program after the grant ends.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>As part of its evaluation plan, UCSF SBIRT is evaluating process, curriculum development outcome, curriculum effectiveness, and dissemination effectiveness.</li>
              <li>Curriculum effectiveness is measured using standardized patient pre- and post-assessments. </li>
              <li>De-identified patient screening forms are reviewed to assess the impact of the UCSF SBIRT curriculum.</li>
            </ul>
