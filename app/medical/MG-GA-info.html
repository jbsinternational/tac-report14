    <h3 class="accordion-header">Population Served</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul>
          <li>In 2006, the Medical Center of Central Georgia, Mercer's primary teaching hospital system, identified more than 10,000 inpatient and outpatient alcohol and drug-related visits by 3,632 different patients. </li>
          <li>Survey data suggest that approximately 200,000 persons in Bibb County are at-risk alcohol or substance users who could potentially benefit from screening and brief intervention.</li>
          <li>In 2008, approximately 7.7 percent of North Carolinians aged 12 and older report past-month illicit drug use, and 19 percent report past-month binge alcohol use. Main drugs of abuse include crack cocaine, marijuana, and prescription drugs. Methamphetamine use is increasing, particularly in the western counties near Wake Forest University. </li>
          <li>In 2006, North Carolina had more than 16,000 admissions to drug and alcohol treatment programs. This number pales in comparison to the more than half-million citizens who, in 2008, reported needing but not receiving treatment for substance abuse within the past year.</li>
          <li>The South Carolina Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services (DAODAS) estimates that approximately 236,000 out of 4.3 million South Carolina residents (5.5 percent) have &quot;substance abuse problems that require immediate intervention and treatment.&quot; In 2006–2007, DAODAS served 48,299 clients (20 percent of those needing treatment), so the unmet need for screening, diagnosis, and intervention remains high.</li>
        </ul>
