    <h3 class="accordion-header">Population Served</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul>
          <li>Patients come from Montgomery (which includes the city of Dayton), Greene, Warren, Miami, and Butler Counties in Ohio, where the population is 1.35 million, and 1 in 10 individuals are likely to have a substance abuse problem. </li>
          <li>Dayton has a high level of drug activity, attributed largely to the city&rsquo;s proximity to the interstate freeway system. Consequently, the prevalence of methamphetamine, benzodiazepine, and opioid-related substance abuse is particularly high among patients.</li>
          <li>The patient population is 85 percent White and 15 percent minority (Black, Hispanic, Asian, or more than one race). </li>
          <li>One in 10 patients live below the poverty level.</li>
          <li>Approximately one-third of patients are younger than 18.</li>
          <li>Approximately 15 percent of patients over age 5 have a disability.    </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Trainee Populations</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <ul>
        <li>Up to 63 KMC medical residents in year 1, from internal medicine, psychiatry, transitional year, and emergency medicine</li>
        <li>Up to 160 KMC nonresidents annually, including nursing students, physician assistant students, and clinical pastoral education students  </li>
