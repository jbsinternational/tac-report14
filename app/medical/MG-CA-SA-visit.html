        <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Natividad screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) medical residency training is comprehensive, with interactive seminars that include lectures, skills-based training, video clips, role-playing activities, case studies, discussions, debriefings, physicians as trainers, and peer-to-peer training opportunities. </li>
              <li>Several curriculum modules are unique and noteworthy, including the module on physician wellness and the impaired physician.</li>
              <li>A comprehensive, interactive 16-hour training for residents stresses community practice with a cross-cultural emphasis.</li>
              <li>The program&rsquo;s training materials focus on cultural competence.</li>
              <li>Family medicine residents receive intensive SBIRT orientation training in their first month of residency and participate in structured, quarterly training/learning exercises (1- and 2-hour sessions) throughout their 3-year residency.</li>
              <li>SBIRT program staff members provide one-on-one resident training, coaching, and feedback supporting SBIRT skills development. </li>
              <li>To strengthen residents&rsquo; understanding of the materials, all residents have opportunities to teach others.</li>
              <li>Natividad&rsquo;s SBIRT curriculum includes several unique, community-minded outreach components, including training for residents and <em>promotores </em>(community health aides), who provide education to at-risk populations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header"> Implementation</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The SBIRT medical residency program has been implemented at seven sites, including the emergency department, inpatient services, primary care clinic, a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs program that serves aging veterans, a college health center, a high school for at-risk youth, an outreach office at a homeless shelter, and a residential substance abuse treatment facility.</li>
              <li>These practice settings provide a broad range of training and learning experiences for residents and demonstrate the flexibility and utility of SBIRT in a number of venues. </li>
              <li>Work in these settings is consistent with and part of the medical center&rsquo;s commitment to community medicine.</li>
              <li>Natividad has deep ties to the community and provides a range of services to migrant farmers working in the county. </li>
              <li>The program strives to effectively serve diverse populations in its cross-cultural practices.</li>
              <li>Allied support staff members are trained in SBIRT at all the practice sites.</li>
              <li>SBIRT staff members are highly proactive in grooming and supporting SBIRT staff champions to inspire peers and supervisory staff to adopt SBIRT.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Working with the County Office of Public Health is a challenge: the two institutions (Natividad and the county) have different cultures, mandates, and operating processes.</li>
              <li>The referral-to-treatment component of SBIRT is a challenge. The current public substance abuse treatment system is difficult to access, particularly because of limited resources for indigent patients and challenges with accessing services for patients with co-occurring substance use and mental disorders.</li>
              <li>Integrating SBIRT activities into the routine workflow has not been clearly defined in all settings. Highly defined processes at sites such as the homeless shelter may not be possible, given the outreach nature of the setting and the population&rsquo;s high level of need.</li>
              <li>Faculty training has been informal and is an area the program continues to work on.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">DISSEMINATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The program trains <em>promotores</em> and medical residents to conduct outreach on a variety of health topics, including SBIRT. </li>
              <li>The program provides SBIRT opportunities for community-based adolescent programs and the drug court.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The program is implementing SBIRT practices into the routine workflow of the Family Practice Clinic, which is moving to a new location in the medical center complex.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>SBIRT has been integrated into the EPIC Oregon Community Health Information Network electronic medical record (EMR) system in inpatient settings and is scheduled to be implemented into all outpatient EMR systems. </li>
              <li>The EMR system will support more timely and consistent delivery of services, improved collaborative care, and consistent documentation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
        <li>Currently, an SBIRT intervention may be completed in the clinic, but it may not be fully recorded in the EMR system.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Evaluation components across all sites capture changes in resident knowledge and skills, direct observation, supervisory rating, and use of an SBIRT proficiency checklist, motivational interviewing, and Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) measures. </li>
              <li>The evaluation is comprehensive and uses multiple data collection strategies to enhance validity.</li>
              <li>Input from site supervisors working with residents increases validity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>The numbers of residents      surveyed to date is relatively small (n = 32).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Accountable care organizations and patient-centered medical homes are supported as important innovations in health care delivery; however, reimbursement systems have lagged behind these initiatives, creating challenges with implementation and sustainability.</li>
              <li>SBIRT billing codes have not been activated in California.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
