        <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee   Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The principal investigators/program directors have significant experience in research, education, and training involving substance abuse treatment in clinical practice. Dr. Daniel Vinson has a long-term commitment to integrating the identification and management of alcohol and drug problems into routine primary care. He led the team that developed and validated a single-question screen for alcohol problems and was the principle investigator on an R01 from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, studying acute alcohol exposure and injury risk. Dr. Vinson is now the project director for the screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) medical residency grant at the University of Missouri (MU)–Columbia&rsquo;s School of Medicine, where he is also a professor of Family and Community Medicine.</li>
              <li>Dr. Bruce Horwitz is a research assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, MU–Columbia. Dr. Horwitz is currently working on several interrelated SBIRT projects including State implementation and residency training grants and a grant to develop a Web-based intervention that is integrated into routine care. Previously, Dr. Horwitz administered community mental health programs for the university and brings that perspective to his SBIRT work with a strong commitment to team approaches and access to a continuum of care.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The SBIRT curriculum was designed to be delivered in various methods, including didactic training modules, didactic lectures, training videos, role-playing exercises with feedback, clinical simulation, and monitored clinical practice with feedback. </li>
              <li>The program team is committed to providing a consistent core curriculum to a diverse group of residents. To achieve this goal, it works with department SBIRT leaders to develop methods for training that will be flexible and adaptive to unique residency program needs.</li>
              <li>The curriculum will continue to evolve as more specialty areas are trained.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Variability across the targeted seven residency program areas (e.g., content area, patient characteristics, practice setting, and workflow) may act as a barrier to standardization. The core curriculum provides a basic knowledge and skill set across all program areas, and the adaptation component provides the flexibility to target SBIRT training and education material to the unique needs and considerations of a given residency program. However, program area variability may result in significant differences in curriculum, training design, and delivery that may cause challenges for the evaluation. For example, residents are taught about screening instruments, but not all are using them as intended. </li>
              <li>The application of overall concepts in screening and brief interventions is encouraged, but residents are not necessarily taught to adhere to specific evidence-based protocols.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Several medical specialty areas support SBIRT training for their residents, including family medicine, internal medicine, adolescent and child health, obstetrics/gynecology, surgery, and psychiatry. </li>
              <li>Departmental champions have emerged who have been instrumental in advocating for SBIRT and finding ways to implement it in their departments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
        <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">DISSEMINATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The screening instrument developed by MU&rsquo;s SBIRT medical residency program consists of three items—one related to alcohol use and two related to substance use.</li>
              <li>The screening tools and approaches to screening are flexible. For example, the Psychiatry Department uses the CAGE instrument to screen patients, whereas social workers will likely screen surgery and trauma patients because of the Uniform Policy Provisions Law (UPPL). The UPPL allows insurers to deny insurance coverage for injuries sustained while a patient was intoxicated or under the influence of another drug.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The didactic training modules reside on the university&rsquo;s Blackboard system, which has limitations. Blackboard is not useful for public dissemination of the training modules beyond the university setting. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
        <li>Blackboard&rsquo;s tracking capability is limited. For example, SBIRT program evaluation staff use a burdensome process to manually transfer Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) responses into the SAIS and to determine whether a resident completed a training module, thus impeding the tracking of resident and departmental training progress. </li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Grantee-Led Enhancement</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Technology Solutions and Grantee Evaluation
                <ul>
                  <li>Continue with plans to move the online training from the Blackboard system to the Web and to collect both baseline and followup GPRA data via the new site. Once the online application becomes active (scheduled for February 2011), unique identifiers will be automatically assigned to each record and the retrieval of the follow up GPRA survey will be automated.</li>
