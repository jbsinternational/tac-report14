        <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The SBIRT at ACCESS medical residency program has designed a comprehensive and succinct four-part, online core screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) curriculum for primary care residents in multiple specialty areas.</li>
                <li>The program’s four-fold “pocket pal” has proved an excellent reference resource for residents.</li>
                <li>The curriculum has been modified and adapted according to the needs and availability of the residents.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The evaluation of ACCESS facilities revealed a significant increase in implementation as residents are trained and SBIRT is embedded in each setting</li>
                <li>SBIRT at ACCESS is implemented in federally qualified health center sites.</li>
                
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Residents indicated that time is a major constraint in providing SBIRT services. As a result, they cannot perform screenings and brief interventions with their patients and resort instead to direct referrals to treatment.</li>
              <li>Overall, the degree of site adherence to the SBIRT model is not clear.</li>
              <li>Residents reported needing to ensure that patients who identified as requiring additional treatment had resources immediately available to them. ACCESS has developed community referral resources; however, referral to treatment continues to be one of the highest need areas.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
          </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The program has impressive buy-in from ACCESS management and physicians. </li>
                <li>This buy-in lends itself to the sustainability of SBIRT in the ACCESS community.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
          <ul>
              <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION </h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>ACCESS has successfully extended its evaluation beyond knowledge transfer and training satisfaction.</li>
                <li>The evaluation team has collected information that shows trends in SBIRT implementation. This information could be prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Currently, the ACCESS project director leads and manages chart audits, including training health center staff and residents to identify patients who need annual screenings. This process should be reviewed because it is not a sustainable approach. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Grantee-Led Enhancements </strong></p>
<ul>
      <li>Implementation
        <ul>
          <li>Develop a medical assistant (MA) model. The residents support using MAs in the screening and brief intervention processes. ACCESS is reviewing an MA model for implementation.<strong></strong></li>
          <li>Review the current approach to managing chart audits, including training health center staff and residents to identify patients who need annual screenings.<strong></strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Dissemination<strong></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Consider documenting and publishing a &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; document about the experience of thoroughly reviewing and implementing SBIRT in an electronic health record system. Because the ACCESS program is not a medical school or a medical residency program and it works collaboratively with multiple medical residency programs in the Chicago area, information about its experiences would be invaluable for other grantees and medical settings.  </li>
          <li>Consider<strong> </strong>preparing a document about the success of ACCESS in extending its evaluation beyond knowledge transfer and training satisfaction and submitting<strong> </strong>it to a peer-reviewed journal.<strong></strong></li>
        </ul>

      </ul>
      <li>Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Organize a &ldquo;study tour/think tank&rdquo; event at the Carter Center on SBIRT in medical residency programs.</li>
