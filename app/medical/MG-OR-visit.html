        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) medical residency training program has developed a patient-centered medical home model in which the screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) model is embedded. </li>
              <li>This strategy is intended to normalize SBIRT in the clinical process. </li>
              <li>Physician assistants, nurses, and office staff are included in the normal workflow.</li>
              <li>Each residency site designates at least one staff champion and one physician champion.</li>
              <li>The staff champion oversees screening in the clinic and facilitates the integration of SBIRT into clinical office practice. </li>
              <li>The physician champion promotes physician buy-in and the adoption of SBIRT in the residency program. </li>
              <li>The grant supports a percentage of the salaries of the staff champions, physician champions, and residency directors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Scheduling training for residents, faculty, and staff is a challenge.</li>
              <li>Obtaining buy-in from physicians is challenging.</li>
              <li>Billing codes exist for SBIRT in Oregon and are in the electronic medical record (EMR) system, but billing is not occurring for SBIRT services. Facility compliance departments often require additional language in the progress notes to support billing. </li>
              <li>Residents have been inconsistent in documenting SBIRT activities in the EMR, making tracking and monitoring difficult.</li>
              <li>It is difficult to determine whether residents are following the steps for the brief negotiated interview with patients because of inconsistencies between the number of screenings and brief interventions that residents perform and the number of each that are being documented in the EMR. </li>
              <li>SBIRT training and practice in many clinic settings do not focus on actively connecting patients to referral services. </li>
              <li>The community has a shortage of available services for patients who require specialized treatment services.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The program&rsquo;s Web site (http://<a href="http://www.sbirtoregon.org" target="_blank">www.sbirtoregon.org</a>) provides a virtual learning environment for the medical residency program. It houses the training curriculum, alcohol and drug screening forms, role-playing activities, demonstration videos, information on reimbursement, and other materials and resources.</li>
              <li>SBIRT has been incorporated into the EMRs in the OHSU residency clinics where SBIRT is performed. </li>
              <li>An SBIRT smart set is being created to facilitate data entry for patients&rsquo; Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) scores, brief intervention information, physician notes, billing information, and prescription notes. </li>
              <li>The SBIRT smart set will increase buy-in and facilitate the monitoring of fidelity to the SBIRT model.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>SBIRT data input and extraction are limited because of the EMR system&rsquo;s current capacities and tools.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>OHSU&rsquo;s medical residency      training program faculty members have designed and implemented mechanisms      for program sustainability, including embedding SBIRT into residency      practice sites, integrating SBIRT into the EMR system, and providing Web-based      training.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maintaining the faculty&rsquo;s interest and participation in the program after the grant expires will be a challenge. </li>
              <li>Reimbursement rates for SBIRT are low.</li>
              <li>SBIRT is one of many competing priorities in the already busy schedules of residency training programs.</li>
            </ul>
