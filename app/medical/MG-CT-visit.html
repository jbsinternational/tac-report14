        <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee   Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The principal investigator and team members have significant background, research, and clinical experience with alcohol and substance use. Their knowledge and experience provide a strong basis for the medical residency training program and a foundation for promoting screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) sustainability efforts.</li>
              <li>The medical specialty teams train and partner with physician assistants, nurses, and social workers to meet the needs of their patients.</li>
              <li>The Yale SBIRT program partners with Project ASSERT, which provides health promotion advocates who are peer educators/interventionists to help patients access primary care and drug and alcohol treatment services. Project ASSERT uses its network of community partnerships and linkages to provide referrals.  </li>
              <li>Buy-in was garnered from the Council of Residency Directors at the outset of the program. Faculty team leaders have been drawn directly from leaders of specific specialty areas who are passionate about creating and disseminating scholarship on screening and brief intervention. The SBIRT program team and faculty team leaders have significant history with alcohol and substance abuse research and treatment. Their knowledge has provided a foundation for buy-in within departments and across program areas. In addition, team leaders are involved in evaluating, tailoring, and teaching the curriculum to accommodate unique departmental training requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Trainings are adjusted by specialty area using relevant case-specific materials. </li>
              <li>Three hours of training are required for all residents.</li>
              <li>Brief negotiated interview (BNI) adherence and competence checklists are used to assess resident brief intervention and motivational interviewing skills.</li>
              <li>The Web-based curriculum is in the public domain.</li>
              <li>Medical residency training includes didactic presentations, role-playing exercises, standardized patients with observation, and online portions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
        <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Yale&rsquo;s medical residency training program uses a physician implementation model. Each residency site must designate at least one faculty champion to train residents and facilitate the integration of SBIRT into clinical practice. A percentage of each faculty champion&rsquo;s salary is funded by the grant.</li>
              <li>Allocating funds to specialty department leaders allows faculty to dedicate time to train residents and gives the incentive of creating opportunities for cutting-edge scholarship on SBIRT.  </li>
              <li>To motivate residents in the millennial generation, training might include team/group work, technology, and visual learning. </li>
              <li>Yale has developed a series of useful instruments to support delivery of the SBIRT intervention with a high level of fidelity to the model.   </li>
              <li>Yale has developed an informational Web site that provides multiple resources supporting SBIRT implementation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Finding time to schedule training for residents and faculty has presented logistical challenges. It has been difficult to identify times when faculty and staff can meet. The reduction in resident daily work hours limits the amount of access trainers have to residents. Web-based interactive training will provide the flexibility that faculty, residents, and preceptors need to address this challenge. Also, incorporating some redundancy into the system for training ensures that all residents are trained.</li>
              <li>SBIRT is described as a paradigm shift for most physicians, including residents. Residents need to overcome discomfort when discussing and addressing substance use problems with patients and change the tendency to automatically refer patients to a social worker to address substance use problems.</li>
              <li>Obtaining initial buy-in for SBIRT in the psychiatry department was described as challenging.  Some psychiatry residents felt that they already had received training in substance use screening, and several wanted indepth motivational interviewing training beyond the brief intervention contained in BNI.  Adjustments to the curriculum (e.g., adding an hour, more education of motivational interviewing, and more BNI role-playing activities) helped residents see the benefit of learning SBIRT.</li>
              <li>Specialty community-based alcohol and substance abuse referral resources are lacking, especially age-appropriate services for adolescents who are referred from the pediatrics department.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">DISSEMINATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Yale&rsquo;s medical residency training program faculty, staff, and residents are encouraged to develop scholarly papers, posters, and presentations. </li>
              <li>Several abstracts, papers, poster sessions, and presentations have already been developed and delivered at State, national, and international meetings. </li>
              <li>These efforts build on more than 40 years of scholarship and research at Yale in the addictions field. Gail D&rsquo;Onofrio, M.D., M.S., Michael V. Pantalon, Ph.D., Linda C. Degutis, Dr.PH.,  David Fiellin, M.D., and  Patrick G. O&rsquo;Connor, M.D.,  are the developers of BNI, which is the nationally recognized evidence-based SBIRT intervention that has been adopted by multiple national medical settings. </li>
              <li>The Yale staff has successfully used the SBIRT initiative to catalyze several other initiatives, thus improving the integration of addictions services and behavioral health within primary care.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Web site (http://<a href="http://www.yale.edu/sbirt">www.yale.edu/sbirt</a>) provides a virtual learning environment for the medical residency training program. The site contains the curriculum, motivational interviewing and BNI videos, case studies, surveys, journal articles and scholarly papers, and other curricular materials and resources.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Working with the information technology department has been a challenge in transitioning to the new electronic medical record (EMR) system and integrating SBIRT elements into the new system.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Yale&rsquo;s medical residency training program faculty designed and implemented several mechanisms to support program sustainability efforts: </li>
              <li>Building significant capacity within faculty to train and support SBIRT</li>
              <li>Embedding SBIRT into routine practices</li>
              <li>Training allied health staff</li>
              <li>Tailoring training programs to the unique contexts of various residency programs</li>
              <li>Developing Web-based training capacity, including using a virtual BNI training coach</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The development of the Web-based BNI virtual coach is important to Yale&rsquo;s SBIRT sustainability efforts. The virtual coach is a Web-based interactive application that provides users with case scenarios where BNI skills are applied and real-time feedback on the intervention. At this time, funding for this program is insufficient. SBIRT program staff are attempting to identify sources of funding for the virtual coach.</li>
              <li>Another concern for the sustainability of the SBIRT medical residency training program will be maintaining the faculty&rsquo;s interest and participation in the program after the grant ends. Currently, portions of the faculty champions&rsquo; salaries are supported by the grant, and this funding will not be available after the grant expires. </li>
              <li>Although Connecticut has activated its SBIRT billing codes and facilities are capable of billing, services are not currently being billed. The staff indicated that the rates are so low that the business office determined that it would cost more in staff time to bill for the services than the institution would receive for reimbursement.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The BNI adherence scales (BAS) assess adherence (whether the prescribed BNI action was done), addresses how well the BNI is done, and monitors fidelity of the intervention.</li>
              <li>How well the BAS would work when applied to drug interventions awaits further study.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Staff described difficulty determining the full extent to which residents are performing BNIs with patients. There appear to be inconsistencies in the number of screenings and BNIs performed by residents and the number of BNIs that are being logged in the EMR.</li>
              <li>Getting residents to document an accurate count of the screening and brief interventions they perform is challenging. This challenge is exacerbated in the shift to the EPIC system from current EMR system.</li>
            </ul>
