            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The experiential practicum allows supervised, hands-on practice with patients in the emergency department. Videotaped role-playing encourages the trainees to critique themselves, and it provides group feedback to enhance the learning experience.</li>
                <li>The Howard University (HU) screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) curriculum emphasizes the importance of the doctor­–patient relationship and cultural competency in reducing alcohol and substance use disorders and related health care disparities in primary care settings.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>

        <h3 class="accordion-header"> Implementation</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>HU has a new, state-of-the-art standardized training facility for residents to complete their clinical skills examination. This facility provides an excellent opportunity for residents to practice their SBIRT knowledge with trained actors. Patient encounters are videotaped, and residents receive feedback from both program staff and their standardized patients.</li>
                <li>SBIRT program staff and department leaders participated in the Brief Negotiated Interview-Active Referral to Treatment (BNI-ART) training, led by Dr. Edward Bernstein of Boston University, as part of a train-the-trainer effort. BNI-ART consists of a 3-day training that includes didactic sessions, role-playing (videotaped critique and feedback), discussions, and motivational interviewing skills practice with patients (experiential practicum). </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Time was identified as a limitation. Residents mentioned that they may not be able to use SBIRT in the limited time provided during a patient encounter. </li>
                <li>Residents tend to focus on patients who meet abuse or dependence criteria. During discussions, one resident observed that SBIRT is  perceived as being more easily integrated in outpatient settings than in inpatient facilities.</li>
                <li>Although many department leaders support SBIRT, program staff members find it challenging to identify champions from each department to promote SBIRT and assist with sustainability planning. Efforts to identify resident champions are ongoing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">DISSEMINATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To promote SBIRT efforts, HU staff have participated in many conferences, including the Historical Black Colleges and Universities Behavioral Health Summit, the Screening and Brief Intervention Training for Trauma Care Providers, National Medical Association, the 31st Forum for Behavioral Science in Family Medicine, the SBIRT Medical Residency Grantee Meeting, the Congressional Black Caucus, and radio interviews.</li>
                <li>HU has received visits from various department directors such as R. Gil Kerlikowske, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. </li>
                <li>Several publications have been completed or are in process.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
      <li>Note noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>HU created a new SBIRT training manual and developed new standardized patient cases. The program views the manual as a legacy that can sustain SBIRT beyond the life of the grant.</li>
                <li>HU plans to maintain its SBIRT training components: lectures, clinical skills development, Blackboard modules (a self-directed learning component of the SBIRT curriculum consisting of six sessions), and the clinical skills evaluations. Staff confirmed that standardized patient practice sessions and the Graduate Medical Education lecture series are guaranteed to continue.</li>
                <li>The New Freedmen&rsquo;s Clinic is a free, student-run clinic on the HU campus. Clinic residents provide SBIRT services for the targeted population at no cost.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
      <li>HU SBIRT staff would like to have a stronger presence within the hospital to increase sustainability efforts. The current program does not have an office in the hospital, and residents need to walk across &ldquo;an invisible&rdquo; barrier to meet with SBIRT staff. Program staff members believe that having an office in the hospital would reinforce the provision of consistent SBIRT services</li></ul></div>

            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Note noted</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The online Blackboard system has been a challenge for HU&rsquo;s residents. The modules include SBIRT-related presentations, mastery quizzes, and readings. Time is an issue because each module takes approximately 2 ½ hours to complete. HU would like to make the Blackboard system a more interactive learning component. </li>
                <li>HU&rsquo;s electronic medical record (EMR) system does not include SBIRT at this time. Residents are encouraged to screen every patient using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Items (AUDIT-C), Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST), CRAFFT, or TWEAK, as appropriate; however, currently the patient&rsquo;s chart has no mechanism to document whether a screen was administered or if the patient received a brief intervention (if warranted by a positive screen). Efforts to incorporate SBIRT into the EMR system are ongoing.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Grantee-Led Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Implementation
    <ul>
      <li>Send identified champions to Boston to receive BNI-ART training, and offer continuing medical education credits as an incentive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Technology Solutions
    <ul>
      <li>Replace the online Blackboard system. The program established a contract with Centrax to develop an interactive Web-based learning component that uses a culturally diverse patient who responds realistically to an SBIRT encounter. HU feels this hands-on training will benefit residents.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
            </ul>
