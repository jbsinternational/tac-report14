<h3>What is SBIRT?</h3>
<p>Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is a comprehensive, integrated, public health approach to the delivery of early intervention and treatment services for people with substance use disorders, as well as those at risk for developing these disorders. Primary care centers, hospital emergency rooms, trauma centers, and other community settings provide opportunities for early intervention with at-risk substance users before more severe consequences occur.<br />
Since 2003, SAMHSA&rsquo;s Division of Services Improvement, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (DSI/CSAT) has been providing grants to promote SBIRT practices. To date, SAMHSA has funded:</p>
<ul>
  <li>17 Medical Residency Training Program Grants</li>
  <li>27 Â State Cooperative Agreements</li>
  <li>12 Targeted Capacity Expansion Campus Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) Grants</li>
  <li>14 Medical Professional Training Program Grants</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>What is the Medical Residency Training Program?</h3>
<p> Medical Residency Training Program grantees develop and implement training programs to teach medical residents and allied health care professionals the knowledge and skills to provide evidence-based SBIRT for patients at risk for substance use disorders and who are in primary care and in various medical specialties. They also train local and statewide medical communities to broaden dissemination of SBIRT practices.<br />
