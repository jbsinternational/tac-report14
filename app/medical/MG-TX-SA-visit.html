        <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee   Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>SBIRT-South Texas Area Residency Training (S-START) has adapted different strategies to formulate a more effective and efficient leadership body. </li>
              <li>Members of the Council of Residency Directors are engaged and actively promote screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) within their departments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>S-START has allowed each specialty area to adopt SBIRT in its own way, recognizing the necessity for flexibility on curriculum development within each setting.</li>
              <li>S-START emphasizes adolescent mental health in pediatric settings. It has developed a comprehensive set of materials to assess adolescent risk of substance use and abuse. The program uses the SHADESS psychosocial interview format, which screens for a broad range of psychosocial issues affecting youth, including depression, peer pressure, suicide, and home environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">DISSEMINATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <ul>
              <li>The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) has adapted the SBIRT curriculum across departments (e.g., Pediatrics, Family and Community Medicine [FCM], Obstetrics and Gynecology, Internal Medicine, Adult and Child Psychiatry, Trauma Surgery) and throughout the State in diverse settings, including military installations at Fort Hood and Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC). To date, S-START has surpassed original resident training goals (n = 539) and revised its 5-year goal to extend its reach (n = 679).</li>
              <li>S-START has introduced SBIRT to both residents and medical students. Dissemination of SBIRT in the medical school setting has helped normalize SBIRT within the resident programs and improve the capacity to address substance use during patient encounters.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>S-START has successfully diffused itself across multiple UTHSCSA departments and settings. </li>
              <li>Residents, faculty members, and nonmedical support staff have endorsed the program.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Resident work-hour restrictions make it challenging to integrate SBIRT into resident training curricula. </li>
              <li>Residents perform prescreens and screens, but it is unclear how well positive screens are translated into brief interventions or referrals to treatment.</li>
              <li>Referral services in outpatient settings are underused because residents are not familiar with referral options. Inpatient settings would benefit from onsite referral support staff, such as licensed chemical dependency counselors and social workers.</li>
              <li>Geographical diversity is both a success and a challenge. Although SBIRT&rsquo;s presence is far reaching, sites are spread over great distances across the State, and not all programs are familiar with one another&rsquo;s activities. </li>
              <li>Th UTHSCSA Psychiatry residency program is somewhat resistant to participate in SBIRT, although SBIRT is being integrated into the curriculum. Leadership has made inroads in this department, but not to the extent of other programs.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Multiple champions within departments assist in normalizing SBIRT in their respective curricula and increase the likelihood of SBIRT continuing as a sustainable practice once the grant ends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
        <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The S-START Web site (<a href="http://familymed.uthscsa.edu/sstart/" target="_blank">http://familymed.uthscsa.edu/sstart/</a> ) serves as a comprehensive training resource for faculty and residents. It contains the program&rsquo;s eight core curriculum training modules and resources that address drug, alcohol, tobacco, and opioid abuse. Visitors can find out about billing and reimbursement protocol and learn motivational interviewing strategies.</li>
              <li>S-START has also developed the Bexar County Substance Abuse Resources Directory <a href="http://bexarlist.com/" target="_blank">http://bexarlist.com/</a>, a free, searchable online directory of local and national resources. The directory provides contact information and descriptions of program philosophy, services, target populations, and fee structures.</li>
              <li>S-START has incorporated SBIRT into electronic medical records (where possible) and paper-based records. Residents indicated that SBIRT reminders on electronic or paper-based charts are very helpful.</li>
              <li>Pediatrics is implementing an iPad pilot project in which all pediatric residents will receive an iPad preloaded with reminders, algorithms, and forms for easy access to SBIRT information among other pediatric training materials and resources.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Although parts of SBIRT training are online and accessible to residents, using Blackboard is an area that needs future adjustments.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Texas State Legislature approved significant budget cuts to Medicaid funding that will affect access to health care services, particularly the number of resources available to patients who are referred to treatment. Budget cuts of 26 percent occurred in the past year.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

 <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>S-START has a robust evaluation component that includes both process and long-term (i.e., 36 months) outcome level data.</li>
              <li>The program has done a good job disseminating lessons learned into presentation opportunities on local and national levels.</li>
              <li>Competency and proficiency are measured using the mini-CEX, and further development in this area is being explored.</li>
              <li>The evaluation team has exceeded evaluation requirements by embarking on a large-scale chart review effort to measure patient outcomes (in Pediatrics and FCM).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>It has been challenging to get residents to complete Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) followup and other local evaluation reports. Followup rates at 12 and 24 months continue to be relatively low. </li>
              <li>Tracking residents from other program areas and those who may have already left UTHSCSA continues to pose a challenge. </li>
              <li>Program evaluators noted that it is challenging to evaluate SBIRT across specialties, especially when various departments adapted the core curriculum to fit their specialty areas and have incorporated SBIRT into their curricula in differing ways (e.g., Web based, lectures, and inpatient/outpatient rotations). Evaluators hope to aggregate the first year&rsquo;s findings to inform processes better.</li>
            </ul>
