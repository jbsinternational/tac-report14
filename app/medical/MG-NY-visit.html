        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Albany Medical Center (AMC) has developed a comprehensive screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) curriculum that has been well received by the residents and faculty.</li>
                <li>SBIRT training seminars use a variety of interactive teaching methods, including didactic learning sessions, videos, role-playing, and standardized patient sessions.</li>
                <li>The online modules have comprehensive information on addiction medicine (Addiction 101) that addresses topics such as experimental use, repeated use, addiction, abstinence, and relapse. </li>
                <li>The role-playing and standardized patient sessions provide an opportunity for residents to practice providing brief interventions and receive immediate feedback.</li>
                <li>Modules continue to be added to the curriculum. Additional modules will be based on feedback from faculty and medical residents.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header"> Implementation</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>AMC has achieved total buy-in from the Department of Psychiatry. </li>
              <li>Dr. Henry Pohl, vice dean for Academic Affairs, and Dr. Joel Bartfield, associate dean for Graduate Medical Education, are strong champions for the program. They play an important role in ensuring SBIRT is incorporated into routine medical training at AMC.</li>
              <li>Faculty mentors have been identified.</li>
              <li>The AMC Outpatient Psychiatry Clinic bills for SBIRT services.</li>
              <li>The new AMC Clinical Competency Center (CCC) will expand training capacity to 16 examining rooms, 1 simulation operating room, and 1 simulation radiology room. Residents and faculty will be able to watch training sessions from any location, online, and in real time. This capability will ease some of the burden for scheduling training sessions for residents and faculty across specialty areas.</li>
              <li>In anticipation of the expanded capacity and capabilities of the CCC, the SBIRT team is developing new SBIRT patient scenarios for specific medical specialties. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Time is a challenge for both residents and faculty. Some faculty members across specialty areas indicate that they have little or no time for training and implementation of SBIRT, and they have been resistant to implementing the program. </li>
              <li>Faculty members are concerned about the time residents spend with patients and whether it is feasible to conduct screening and brief intervention services in a time-constrained clinical setting.</li>
              <li>Residents find it challenging to allow time for completing the online modules, attending demonstration sessions, role-playing, and participating in standardized patient sessions. In response to these concerns, AMC has revised the training to be in line with the specialty areas. More departments are designating blocks of their education time to teach their residents SBIRT, which seems to improve the training process.</li>
              <li>The program uses a faculty mentor model to train residents across specialty areas. Because of time constraints, identifying faculty members who are willing to step into the faculty mentor role has been a challenge. </li>
              <li>Buy-in regarding SBIRT efficacy and feasibility varies greatly among the departments.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Integrating SBIRT standardized patient scenarios into the CCC will help sustain the SBIRT program once grant funds have ended. New specialty-specific scenarios are in development. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Billing is a challenge across all specialty areas. Reimbursement for SBIRT is generally considered to be too low to make billing worthwhile in some departments. The processes and procedures for billing differ across departments, and incorporating a new service can be complicated and time intensive. </li>
                <li>Uniform Policy Provision Law and confidentiality issues are concerns across specialty areas. </li>
                <li>Limited addiction referral resources in the Albany area are potential barriers to residents and attending physicians who would like to screen patients for substance abuse but hesitate to do so because of the limited options for those who need treatment.</li>
            </ul>
