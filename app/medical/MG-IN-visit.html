        <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee  Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Indiana University School of Medicine&rsquo;s (IUSM) well-connected steering committee members and strong networking capabilities enhance promotion of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) within and across IUSM and the Wishard Health Network (WHS).<strong></strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Several original SBIRT steering committee members have taken other appointments or positions. Although this staff turnover has been helpful in increasing the use of SBIRT, it has been a challenge to maintain momentum within the program.<strong></strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Employing expert trainers from the Midtown Community Mental Health Center (MCMHC), IUSM has created a customized and condensed motivational interviewing training for its residents and faculty. Initially, the training lasted 2 days; however, it has been condensed to 4 hours.</li>
              <li>IUSM is developing tailored versions of its current internal medicine SBIRT and motivational interviewing training curriculum to be used with other specialty areas such as pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, and family medicine. </li>
              <li>An outside educational consultant is helping adapt the curriculum and Web-based modules to other specialty areas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
        <li>Note noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>IUSM created a marketing campaign with posters that feature the &ldquo;We Ask Everyone&rdquo; tagline. The posters remind physicians to perform SBIRT and comfort patients who may be reticent about answering questions related to their substance use.</li>
              <li>IUSM&rsquo;s policy of screening every patient at every IUSM or WHS clinic appointment enables tracking of patient success over time and enables health care staff to ensure fidelity to intervention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The biggest challenge IUSM faces is time. Residents and staff feel they do not have enough time with patients to incorporate SBIRT into each patient encounter.</li>
        <li>Residents rarely refer patients to the SBIRT counselor. The full benefit of this position is not being realized.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">DISSEMINATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>IUSM focuses on collaboration. It is allied with several organizations, including WHS, MCMHC, Indiana Prevention Resource Center, and Academic Edge. In addition, IUSM&rsquo;s education coordinator is developing a collaboration plan to train outside organizations in SBIRT and motivational interviewing.<strong></strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Note noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>IUSM is in early research stages of incorporating SBIRT screening into its electronic medical record (EMR) system. The Regenstrief Institute, an organization involved in medical informatics, is researching the development of the EMR system. The institute developed the Indiana Health Information Exchange to capture patient information for WHS and to bring together EMR information from across the State.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
        <li>Note noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>IUSM is well connected within the university, has strong networking practices, and has successfully collaborated with the State of Indiana to obtain the State SBIRT implementation grant.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Despite its connections, networks, and collaborations, IUSM lacks a formal sustainability plan.</li></ul></div>
