        <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee   Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The principal investigator and team members had prior knowledge of and experience with screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) from a previous Pennsylvania State SBIRT grant. Their knowledge and experience base provided a strong launch for the SBIRT Medical and Residency Training (SMaRT) program and provide a foundation for State SBIRT sustainability efforts (i.e., Medicaid billing pilot study) and evidence-based practices (i.e., validation of screening and motivational interviewing proficiency tools).</li>
              <li>The SMaRT program effectively uses its committee structure to accomplish its goals and objectives. The committees interact, collaborate, and exchange information effectively. </li>
              <li>The Executive Committee is responsible for final administrative and operational decisions. </li>
              <li>The Advisory Council provides feedback on program implementation and dissemination and advocates for SBIRT training and change practices at the policymaking level. </li>
              <li>The Council of Residency Directors (CRD) assists with program development and implementation and reviews and provides feedback on the curriculum and effectiveness of the evaluation. </li>
              <li>The Project Training and Implementation Team provides the training component of the SMaRT program and ensures that resident and faculty training is implemented effectively. </li>
              <li>The Curriculum Committee works with CRD to ensure that curriculum implementation is effective within each site and works with the Evaluation Committee to assess residents&rsquo; feedback on the curriculum. </li>
              <li>The Evaluation Committee assesses the effectiveness of SBIRT implementation and evaluates performance and outcomes. The Policy Subgroup advocates for policies that further systems change for SBIRT.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The three-tiered, multimodal SMaRT curriculum provides core training, specialty- and population-specific training, and training for faculty and advanced learners.</li>
              <li>The curriculum can be delivered in various methods, including face-to-face and Web-based slide presentations as well as didactic lectures, videos, role-playing exercises, and preceptor observations—resulting in dynamic trainings that improve resident knowledge and skill development.</li>
              <li>Faculty and resident needs assessments guided the curriculum design.</li>
              <li>Physician learning styles were considered in developing the training modules.</li>
              <li>The program requires 8 hours of training for all residents.</li>
              <li>Proficiency checklists are used to assess resident&rsquo;s brief intervention and motivational interviewing skills</li>
              <li>The Web-based curriculum is in the public domain.</li>
              <li>Continuing medical education credits are provided for community preceptors who complete a comprehensive 10-module training course.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
          <ul>
              <li>SBIRT is being implemented in clinical practice in four Pittsburgh communities and in Philadelphia.</li>
              <li>Implementation protocols are provided for residencies, champions, testing, evaluation, and clinical application.</li>
              <li>Participating residencies are provided with clearly defined expectations, responsibilities, and protocols.</li>
              <li>The SMaRT program uses a physician implementation model. Each residency site must designate at least one faculty champion to train residents and facilitate the integration of SBIRT into clinical practice. Faculty champions are funded.</li>
              <li>The amount of time required to implement SBIRT training varies depending on the structure of the program and the number of faculty and residents to be trained.</li>
              <li>The program staff, dean, champions, and faculty are enthusiastic about the SBIRT medical residency program and invested in ensuring its success at the University of Pittsburgh.</li>
              <li>Medical school faculty members who participate on the various SMaRT program committees and who serve as champions were instrumental in garnering buy-in from other medical school faculty in the early stages of the project&rsquo;s development. The faculty has also been involved in evaluating, revising, and packaging the curriculum to accommodate physician learning styles and departmental training requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Finding time to schedule training for residents, faculty, and community preceptors has presented logistical challenges. Web-based interactive training will provide the flexibility that faculty, residents, and preceptors need to address this challenge.</li>
            </ul>
      </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">DISSEMINATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>SMaRT program faculty, staff, and residents are encouraged to developed scholarly papers, posters, and presentations. </li>
              <li>Several abstracts, papers, posters, and presentations have been developed and delivered at professional meetings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The &ldquo;Get SMaRT&rdquo; Web site provides a virtual learning environment for the medical residency program. </li>
              <li>The site houses the curriculum, quizzes and other curricular materials and resources, surveys, evaluation instruments, and presentations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Medicaid billing codes for SBIRT have been activated at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) for third-party payers, including Gateway, Highmark, and Unison.</li>
              <li>The SMaRT program is working with RTI on a pilot study to determine whether activation of the Medicaid SBIRT-associated Healthcare Common Procedure Codes can result in cost savings for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Although three third-party payers have activated the Medicaid billing codes for SBIRT at UPMC, the family medical residency programs have not begun to bill for these services. </li>
              <li>The programs are concerned that under the Uniform Policy Provision Law patients might not receive reimbursement for costs incurred when an accident is a result of the insured patient&rsquo;s alcohol or substance use intoxication.</li>
              <li>The faculty indicated that 42 Code of Federal Regulation might impede record sharing across hospitals and counties. The medical residency programs would like to resolve these issues so that they can bill for services.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Patient encounters are tracked; there have been more than 2,000 patient encounters.</li>
              <li>The evaluation instruments incorporate the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Perception Questionnaire and the Drug and Drug Use Problems Perception Questionnaire.</li>
              <li>Data collection instruments can be completed online.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The residency programs would like to (1) verify that the residents are actually screening and performing brief interventions in the family health centers and (2) understand how the residents are using SBIRT in the patient population.</li>
            </ul>
