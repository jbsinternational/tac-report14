<h3> What is an implementation site visit, and why is it done?</h3>
<p>An implementation site visit is designed to engage the grantee in a discussion of program strengths and a continuing improvement process supported by technical assistance as approved by SAMHSA. This approach encourages the program to leverage strengths and maximize long-term program success and sustainability. Site visits for each of the 17 Medical Residency Training Program grantees were conducted at a point between the end of year 1 and the end of year 3 of funding. </p>
<p>The site visit process surveys grantee activities along certain essential areas of implementation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Realistic performance goals and objectives</li>
  <li>A defined implementation plan with action steps to achieve the plan</li>
  <li>Clearly defined project management agreements and roles, including partners</li>
  <li>Leadership buy-in supporting program readiness and startup, including practice site champions</li>
  <li>Defined systems for regular communication among partners, as well as easy access for ad hoc communication</li>
  <li>Protocols for program operations, including use of technology, common sets of tools, and processes</li>
  <li>Participatory decisionmaking among implementation team members</li>
  <li>Ongoing training, technical assistance, monitoring, and coaching to support implementation, fidelity to the model, and sustainability</li>
  <li>Use of evaluation to support and monitor implementation</li>
  <li>Sensitivity to unique contextual conditions at the practice sites, the populations being served, and any associated need for adaptation</li>
</ul>
<h3>What happens during an implementation site visit?</h3>
<p>The site visit teams consist of previously successful SBIRT implementers (peer mentors) and staff from the Technical Assistance contract (JBS International, Inc., and Alliances for Quality Education, Inc.). Team tasks include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engaging grantees and key stakeholders in meaningful discussions</li>
  <li>Observing and reporting on grantee implementation progress</li>
  <li>Identifying grantee strengths and challenges</li>
  <li>Identifying any potential enhancements that might be supported by technical assistance, as approved by SAMHSA</li>
  <li>Providing technical assistance, when appropriate</li>
</ul>
<p>The site visit process includes multiple components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advance preparation by the team reviewing grant applications, periodic reports, and discussions with the project officer </li>
  <li>Meeting onsite with principal investigators/project directors, medical directors, curriculum chairs, deans, residency directors, program champions, training coordinators, distance learning staff, faculty, clinical staff, residents, evaluators, data entry staff, Web site developers, Web-based interactive training developers, and others</li>
  <li>Conducting conference calls with residency directors</li>
  <li>Reviewing curriculum components and materials (paper and electronic)</li>
  <li>Visiting SBIRT implementation and clinical sites and interviewing staff</li>
  <li>Visiting simulation centers</li>
  <li>Observing training sessions</li>
  <li>Meeting with key implementation partners</li>
  <li>Meeting with the Policy Steering Committee</li>
</ul>
<h3>What have been the outcomes of conducting these site visits?</h3>
<p>Overall, the grantees have responded extremely positively to these site visits. Positive outcomes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Forging constructive relationships between grantees and grantee mentors (also called peer consultants)</li>
  <li>Expanding project officers&rsquo; knowledge of grantee operations</li>
  <li>Identifying and sharing lessons learned and unique and notable grantee accomplishments</li>
  <li>Providing immediate onsite feedback and assistance to grantees</li>
  <li>Increasing grantee comfort and knowledge about the technical assistance process</li>
  <li>Obtaining specific requests for technical assistance from several granteesâ€”on topics such as developing branding and marketing tools, adapting curricula to other specialty areas, developing and translating materials for Spanish-speaking populations, developing plans to disseminate curricula and materials, and obtaining continuing medical education credit and peer review</li>
</ul>
