                        <p>The Howard University (HU) SBIRT Medical Residency Program completed several activities as of the site visit date: created a manual of standard operating procedures that documents SBIRT background information, procedures, and requirements; implemented a cutting-edge standardized patient training facility where the residents perform SBIRT clinical skills examinations, receive written documentation of their performance, view a video recording of their patient encounter, and receive immediate feedback from the standardized patient; and developed an integrated curriculum that includes both didactic and experiential learning components (including lecture, practice session, online modules, five documented patient encounters, and a clinical skills examination).</p>

                        <p>In its first 3 grant years, the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) School of Medicine medical residency training program developed a core curriculum using the brief negotiated interview model that has been implemented in the family medicine, internal medicine, and preventive medicine residency programs; developed evaluation tools to assess SBIRT training and clinic implementation; developed laminated pocket cards, role plays, billing guides, and other training tools; launched a Web site (<a href="http://www.sbirtoregon.org" target="_blank">www.sbirtoregon.org</a>) featuring the full curriculum, training videos, screening instruments, and resources; adopted a systems approach to SBIRT training; built capacity within practice sites before having residents begin practicing SBIRT; and organized its practice sites as patient-centered medical homes.</p>
