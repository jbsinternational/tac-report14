        <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee   Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Community Council members are enthusiastic about screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) and express interest in implementing SBIRT in various settings across the State.<strong></strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong><strong> </strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Kettering Medical Center&rsquo;s (KMC) unique training includes several components: didactic presentations, small seminars that address SBIRT skills development, and &ldquo;bedside&rdquo; consults where the resident and an SBIRT trainer conduct the intervention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong><strong> </strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The training schedule is flexible and allows for individualized resident education over the course of the month-long rotation.</li>
              <li>SBIRT documentation has increased over time, largely because of a resident incentive program (including certificates and small prizes awarded to residents who meet documentation goals) and games (residents in surrounding hospitals engage in a friendly competition over which setting has the most successful SBIRT chart entries). </li>
              <li>SBIRT program staff have adapted games (e.g., BINGO, Jeopardy, an SBIRT Scrabble tool) to reinforce the SBIRT curriculum and make learning fun. On an equally playful note, KMC&rsquo;s mascot, &ldquo;SBIRT&rdquo; (a caped character resembling Burt from Sesame Street), reminds residents to perform and document SBIRT.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>KMC program staff have found it challenging to identify SBIRT champions in outpatient services.</li>
              <li>Time constraints make it difficult for residents to address patients&rsquo; substance abuse issues and chief health complaints during a typical patient encounter. </li>
        <li>Work-hour restrictions and rotating resident schedules can be burdensome to coordinate SBIRT training.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong><strong> </strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>KMC&rsquo;s program evaluator has a limited presence in the program.</li>
            <li>Staff are spread too thin to satisfy all evaluation components they would like to accomplish.</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Grantee-Led Enhancements</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Implementation<strong></strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Enhance adoption by expanding SBIRT&rsquo;s reach within the community and partnering with county-level programs and managed health care organizations.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>Keep resident class sizes small to make it easier to conduct individualized trainings in developing skills for brief interventions using motivational interviewing techniques.<strong></strong></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Sustainability Planning<strong></strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Identify other program champions, and document the training process and curriculum so that training can continue in the future. <strong></strong></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Grantee Evaluation<strong></strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Review and consider evaluation products developed by other teams, including a resident proficiency checklist tool and long-term followup measures.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>Establish more robust evaluation strategies to accurately capture the effectiveness of SBIRT training on KMC residents, faculty, and patient populations.<strong></strong></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>Explore the possibility of quantifying resident proficiency so that it can translate into appropriate adjustments in curriculum, educational objectives, learning style, and assessment strategy, among other items. This effort could manifest as a potential technical assistance request and enhance future publication opportunities.</li>
