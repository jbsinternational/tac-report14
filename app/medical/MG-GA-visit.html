        <h3 class="accordion-header">CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Mercer University&rsquo;s screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) medical residency training is comprehensive. </li>
              <li>Interactive seminars include standardized patient scenarios, video clips, role-playing, case studies, discussions, and debriefings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong><strong></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header"> Implementation</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mercer staff have successfully collaborated with two other resident training programs and implemented SBIRT in four locations spanning three States.</li>
              <li>Mercer has enhanced the SBIRT model by developing and implementing a pain management and prescription medication protocol. This Mercer model is based on an assessment of patient risk and benefit and is grounded in well-established principles of care.</li>
              <li>Mercer has integrated SBIRT protocols into the routine workflow within different practice settings by completing universal screening on all patients, identifying patients screened as &ldquo;positive&rdquo; for the physician, and having the physician complete a more indepth screen and brief intervention and referral to treatment (when indicated).</li>
              <li>Building on a foundation of previous initiatives, the Mercer team has developed support within the residencies, practice sites, and the Director of Medical Residency Programs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Given the limited time and resources available, SBIRT interventions that are fully delivered by physicians do not &ldquo;make good sense.&rdquo;</li>
              <li>The current public substance abuse treatment system was described as difficult to access and usually lacking services at intensive levels of care.</li>
              <li>The financial resources to support SBIRT lag significantly behind payments routinely made to physicians.</li>
            <li>Accountable care organizations and patient medical homes hold forth promise for SBIRT and behavioral health service integration within primary care. However, with so many unknowns about the models at this time, most physicians are reluctant to act. </li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strength</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>SBIRT has been implemented into the inpatient electronic health record (EHR) system and is scheduled to be implemented into the outpatient EHR system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges </strong></p>
            <ul>
        <li>None noted</li></ul></div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>None noted</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Trained residents will finish the program and most likely begin practice in a Southern State setting that has limited familiarity with SBIRT. The team is concerned about residents&rsquo; ability to sustain their skills in environments that do not provide support and ongoing feedback.</li></ul></div>

                  <li>Complete a financial modeling process to determine true costs for the SBIRT intervention with different practice settings.</li>
                  <li>Explore strategies for building physician support systems for practicing physicians seeking to implement SBIRT.</li>
