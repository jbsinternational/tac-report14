        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Departmental champions have emerged who have been instrumental in advocating for screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) and in finding ways to implement it in their departments. </li>
              <li>Leaders from the Department of Social Work at Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital (BCH) are avid supporters of SBIRT, and they would like SBIRT training for their staff and students.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Curriculum Development</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The BCH medical residency curriculum trains residents to conduct SBIRT for pediatric patients. As a result, BCH&rsquo;s medical school curriculum has the potential to serve as the medical field&rsquo;s premier SBIRT curriculum for pediatric residents.</li>
              <li>BCH SBIRT faculty members continue to edit and update the curriculum based on feedback from residents, training faculty, and evaluation results. In addition to the core modules, supplementary modules have been developed, and online training delivery is in progress as requested by residents and medical faculty.</li>
              <li>The curriculum is currently delivered in an in-person lecture format. Web-based self-study modules are being developed to accommodate medical residents&rsquo; requests and time restrictions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Note noted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Several pediatric medical specialty areas support SBIRT training for their residents, including adolescent medicine, developmental medicine, emergency medicine, and psychiatry.</li>
              <li>The BCH SBIRT medical residency program uses the CRAFFT tool for all adolescent SBIRT screenings. Because the CRAFFT was developed and validated internally, BCH SBIRT support for the screening tool is strong. The use of a standardized assessment tool across resident rotations strengthens resident comfort and skill in using the CRAFFT tool.</li>
              <li>BCH focused on deploying a pediatric-based curriculum into multidisciplinary adolescent treatment areas across participating hospitals. This implementation approach has proved beneficial for BCH. Support for SBIRT implementation has been strong across participating program sites.</li>
              <li>The overview and motivational interviewing modules have been incorporated into the adolescent medicine syllabus, and the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) module is incorporated into the developmental medicine syllabus.  </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Billing challenges were identified across pediatric specialties implementing SBIRT medical residency training (with the exception of child psychiatry). </li>
              <li>Reimbursement is not available for prescreening, brief intervention, motivational interviewing without an associated diagnosis, brief treatment, or SBIRT followup appointments. </li>
              <li>Turning on the SBIRT State codes and enabling residents to bill for SBIRT activities were cited as challenges to implementation in practice.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Dissemination </h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>BCH SBIRT is motivated to disseminate the pediatric curriculum to other SBIRT medical residency grantees and to the larger medical community. </li>
              <li>Because few other SBIRT medical residency training curricula address substance use in adolescents, the BCH curriculum can offer a unique contribution to other SBIRT programs.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The medical residency training program currently has no recognizable brand for marketing materials. BCH has employed a designer to assist with consistent imaging for all curriculum material. BCH faculty would like the same designer to develop a specific BCH SBIRT brand for use with all associated marketing material.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Technology Solutions</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>BCH SBIRT is committed to developing technological solutions for prescreening, assessment, and brief intervention scripting.</li>
              <li>Use of computers on wheels in the emergency department has reduced the staff time required to perform SBIRT activities.</li>
              <li>The program has integrated its existing electronic medical record system with new technical developments designed for SBIRT. </li>
              <li>Staff and faculty continue to develop innovative methods for computerized assessments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>BCH SBIRT faculty members view a comprehensive dissemination plan as an essential component of their sustainability plan.</li>
              <li>BCH SBIRT overview and motivational interviewing modules have been incorporated into the adolescent medicine residency syllabus, and the ADHD module is incorporated into the developmental medicine residency syllabus. Each module will continue to be taught beyond the life of the grant.  BCH SBIRT will offer the other modules in an electronic format in the future.</li>
              <li>BCH SBIRT is developing a training program for hospital social workers. Training nonmedical clinicians in SBIRT is part of BCH SBIRT medical residency&rsquo;s plan for sustaining SBIRT after grant funding ends.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>

        <h3 class="accordion-header">Recommended Enhancements</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Grantee-Led Enhancements</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Implementation
                <ul>
                  <li>Continue use of standardized patient sessions; consider expanding use to other program areas.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Dissemination
                <ul>
                  <li>Look into obtaining accreditation for continuing medical education (CME) credits for participating in SBIRT training, undergoing a peer review of the curriculum before publishing materials, and adding SBIRT to recertification exams.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>Use the designer who is already developing a marketing plan to also develop branding for curriculum lectures and materials. A brand would increase recognition of BCH SBIRT resources by residents, other SBIRT grantees, and State medical and nonmedical providers.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Technology Solutions<strong></strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Expand the use of existing technological solutions, which are similar to those used in the emergency department, to other program areas.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>Share the underlying algorithm logic and lessons learned from the technological solutions implemented to current and new SBIRT grantees and the larger SBIRT community.<strong></strong></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              
              <li>Sustainability Planning
                <ul>
                  <li>Examine potential strategies for sustainability of existing SBIRT activities.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>Consider developing booster materials, which would be beneficial for long-term retention of SBIRT concepts and skills.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Potential Technical Assistance Requests</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dissemination 
                <ul>
                  <li>Request assistance for developing a plan to disseminate the curriculum and materials, with specific emphasis on obtaining accreditation for CME credit and peer review. BCH faculty members understand that other SBIRT grantees have focused on adult patient populations, and they realize the benefit that their pediatric-focused curriculum can provide to other SBIRT grantees and the larger medical community. </li>
                </ul>
