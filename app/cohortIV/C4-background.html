<h3>What is SBIRT?</h3>
<p>Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is a comprehensive, integrated, public health approach to the delivery of early intervention and treatment services for people with substance use disorders, as well as those at risk for developing these disorders. Primary care centers, hospital emergency rooms, trauma centers, and other community settings provide opportunities for early intervention with at-risk substance users before more severe consequences occur.</p>
<p>Since 2003, SAMHSA’s Division of Services Improvement, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (DSI/CSAT) has been providing grants to promote SBIRT practices. To date, SAMHSA has funded:
    <ul>
        <li>17 Medical Residency Training Program Grants</li>
        <li>27 State Cooperative Agreements</li>
        <li>12 Targeted Capacity Expansion Campus Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) Grants</li>
        <li>14 Medical Professional Training Program Grants</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>What is Cohort IV?</h3>
<p>State grantees in Cohort IV implement SBIRT services for adults in primary care and community health care settings. This program is designed to expand and enhance the State and tribal continuum-of-care services for substance misuse, reduce alcohol and drug consumption and their negative health impact, reduce costly health care utilization, and promote sustainability and behavioral health information technology.</p>
<p>Cohort IV includes 12 State grantees. The following nine grantees were funded in FY 2011, and their cooperative agreements are expected to end in August 2016:

        <li>Tennessee State Department of Mental Health</li>
        <li>Washington State Department of Social and Health Services</li>
    </ul>
