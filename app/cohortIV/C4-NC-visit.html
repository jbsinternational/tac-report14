<h2 class="accordion-header">Grantee Organization and Leadership</h2> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>North Carolina has been proactive in supporting primary care/behavioral health integration for more than 25 years, including physician training within the State's medical schools and primary care specialty groups, piloting SBIRT using State resources, and founding the North Carolina Center of Excellence for Integrated Care.</li>
<li>The Governor's Institute on Substance Abuse is the co-administrator for NC SBIRT. The Institute was founded  in 1991 to support an organizational approach to getting health care professionals, particularly physicians, involved in preventing, identifying, and treating substance abuse.</li>
<li>The North Carolina DMHDDSAS has formed strategic alliances with Community Care of North Carolina, the Governor's Institute on Substance Abuse, statewide faith organizations, and local organizations to collaborate in SBIRT implementation.</li>
<li>DMHDDSAS senior leadership has actively promoted SBIRT adoption statewide.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The NC SBIRT is a complex initiative that involves State, county, and local entities.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="accordion-header">Practice Site Implementation</h2> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee has currently implemented SBIRT at two sites, the Community Care Center (a free clinic in Winston-Salem) and the Family Medicine Clinic at the Wake Forest University Medical Center. Two additional sites are scheduled to begin in July, and the remaining two sites are scheduled to begin in September.</li>
<li>The grantee will be selecting eight unique practice sites, including a Federally Qualified Health Center, spanning the State. Sites include rural and urban locations; sites serving middle-class and indigent populations; sites serving diverse populations, including Latino adults, many with limited English proficiency; and at least two sites that will serve a significantly high proportion of the Lumbee tribe.</li>
<li>Through other resources, the grantee will be piloting SBIRT within the North Carolina ANG.</li>
<li>The Family Medicine Center at Wake Forest has a clearly defined SBIRT workflow that is embedded within the clinic process, supporting universal screening for patients served in the clinic.</li>
<li>The Community Care Center clinic serves a vital role in the community by serving uninsured and indigent persons.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Community Care Center is primarily operated by a largely volunteer medical staff and does not have the supportive infrastructures, such as defined workflow patterns, support staff, and consistent staffing patterns, of a traditionally structured and funded clinic setting.</li>
<li>As staffing patterns change frequently, developing a clearly defined SBIRT workflow that is embedded within the clinic process is challenging and makes universal screening difficult.</li>
<li>Staff from the two provider sites described periodic challenges with timely decisionmaking that impeded their implementation process.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="accordion-header">Cultural Competence</h2> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>North Carolina is seeking to implement SBIRT serving highly diverse populations and cultures including Native Americans, Latinos, rural communities, and faith communities.</li>
<li>The PSC has engaged consumers, faith communities, rural health, and Indian Health Service representation on the committee.</li>
<li>A cultural competence plan is under development in North Carolina, and the SBIRT project will be integrated into the plan.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The approach to SBIRT and its delivery may require adaptation in order to successfully serve these diverse populations.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="accordion-header">Training/Workforce Development</h2> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Governor's Institute is contracted to provide statewide SBIRT training and builds on a foundation of previous SBIRT training/technical assistance and primary care training in addiction medicine.</li>
<li>The grantee has strong internal capacity for physician training and motivational interviewing (MI).</li>
<li>The grantee has launched a highly informative SBIRT <a href="http://www.sbirtnc.org" target="_blank">Web site</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SBIRT training for practice sites and for medical providers outside of Wake Forest has been limited.</li>
<li>The grantee describes challenges with engaging primary care providers.</li>
<li>Practice sites may need technical assistance to support successful implementation.</li>
<li>Systems to support fidelity of implementation were not evident across sites.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="accordion-header">Sustainability</h2> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>North Carolina has fully activated Medicaid and Medicare SBIRT insurance billing codes, and through the Governor's Institute and the North Carolina Center of Excellence for Integrated Care, has developed supportive guidance documents for SBIRT coding and billing in primary care.</li>
<li>The medical director of BCBSNC (North Carolina's largest private insurer) sits on the Policy Steering Committee (PSC) and is committed to working toward implementation.</li>
<li>The practice sites are Community Care of North Carolina Medical Homes and have the infrastructure and disease-management focus that supports preventive care and care for chronic conditions.</li>
<li>The PSC has an essential role in sustainability planning.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Community providers are unfamiliar with the business practices associated with SBIRT, including coding and billing and integration and documentation of SBIRT in emergency medical records (EMRs).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="accordion-header">Policy Steering Committee</h2> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The NC SBIRT PSC includes representation from all key State offices, including the Division of MHDDSAS, the Division of Medical Assistance, the Office of Rural Health, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, the North Carolina American Indian Health Board, physicians, addiction and mental health professions, and consumers.</li>
<li>The PSC has responsibility for policy development, sustainability planning, and supporting marketing of SBIRT statewide.</li>
</ul>


</div>

<h2 class="accordion-header">Evaluation</h2> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee is effectively using data to monitor and support performance. These data are being used to support analysis and performance improvement for successful implementation.</li>
<li>The grantee has contracted with FEI/WITS for electronic GPRA data collection and reporting to SAMHSA.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very preliminary data indicate that the number of patients prescreening as "positive" was well below the anticipated 12 percent to 20 percent for positive prescreens.</li>
</ul>
