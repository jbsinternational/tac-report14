<h3 class="accordion-header"> Population Served</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p>The Connecticut SBIRT Program targets adults, ages 18 and older, at risk for substance misuse or diagnosed with a substance use disorder. Services will be implemented in 10 community health center sites statewide. At least 85 percent of the population served in these clinics are Medicaid or Medicare recipients, and a high percentage of these patients are of racial and linguistic minorities.</p>
<p>At a future date, the grantee proposes to integrate SBIRT into the DMHAS's Military Support Program (MSP), which includes statewide behavioral health services to National Guard members, Reserve members, and their families.</p>
