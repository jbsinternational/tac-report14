    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Strengths</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementation of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is part of the strategic vision for the State.</li>
            <li>The SBIRT initiative has senior-level administrative buy-in and support from the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS).</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>DMHAS is a newly formed State agency that resulted from a merger of substance abuse and mental health services. Significant turnover in staff leadership occurred as a result of the merger.</li>
            <li>Although the strategic goal of Trenton Health Team (THT)—to become an accountable care organization with affiliated patient-centered medical homes—is aligned with the future of emerging health care delivery systems, it will require negotiation between THT and DMHAS to determine where SBIRT integrates into this emerging system.</li>
            <li>THT should continue to make SBIRT a priority and allocate sufficient time and effort to meeting its deliverables.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Strengths</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The grantee has successfully implemented SBIRT in three primary care clinics.</li>
            <li>The grantee implementation team worked with each site to tailor the implementation to the workflow and culture of each organization.</li>
            <li>The grantee has employed a public health planning model using population data to target where SBIRT services will be implemented.</li>
            <li>The grantee experienced startup delays and, as a result, is behind on its performance targets.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The grantee experienced startup delays and, as a result, is behind on its performance targets.</li>




        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Strengths</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each practice site has developed a workflow tailored to its unique operations.</li>
            <li>Practice sites are successfully serving diverse patient populations.</li>
            <li>Each practice site uses a team approach in the delivering SBIRT services and using electronic technologies to support the efforts.</li>
            <li>All practice sites have EHRs.</li>
            <li>SBIRT data collection and reporting are managed within the DMHAS information technology (IT) department, using a sophisticated Web-based data system.</li>


        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In fall 2012, multiple events converged to create challenging conditions affecting startup and implementation.</li>
            <li>The grantee has difficulty meeting the performance targets because of errors calculating the number of patients to be served by THT.</li>
            <li>Staff at practice sites are still learning about SBIRT and motivational interviewing.</li>
            <li>The State has limited capacity for training, practice site technical assistance, and workforce development.</li>
            <li>There is no data interface between the State’s IT system and the practice sites’ EHRs; consequently, patient data require dual entry. IT staff are reluctant to allow such an interface because of concerns regarding practice site data quality.</li>
            <li>No clearly defined set of procedures exists between the practice sites and the evaluation team for Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) followup.</li>
            <li>There is limited physician involvement in SBIRT at the practice sites.</li>
            <li>The policy steering committee was not scheduled to hold its first full meeting until October 2013.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Strength</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>THT is modifying its organizational structure to become an accountable care organization supported by a network of patient-centered medical homes.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Challenge</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The roles of behavioral health care and SBIRT do not appear to be fully developed or understood within the THT model.</li>


        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Strengths</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The New Jersey DMHAS has identified SBIRT as part of an overarching strategy.</li>
            <li>SBIRT services are embedded within EHRs at practice sites.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medicaid does not reimburse for SBIRT services. This presents challenges to developing a viable business model for SBIRT in primary care settings.</li>
            <li>Practice sites have not developed a business practice model that would support SBIRT beyond grant funding.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>Strengths</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The State has contracted with an evaluation and research group experienced in large-scale followup activities among populations that are sometimes difficult to reach.</li>
            <li>Beyond GPRA followup, the grantee plans to conduct formative, outcome, and cost-benefit evaluation activities.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The lack of interface between EHRs and the data collection system requires additional staff labor to complete dual data entries.</li>
            <li>State and the evaluator have not fully developed a plan for 6-month GPRA followup.</li>


        </ul>
    </div>
