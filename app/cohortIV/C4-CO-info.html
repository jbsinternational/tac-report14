<h3 class="accordion-header"> Population Served</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p>Colorado's population is primarily Caucasian (88 percent), with 20 percent identified as of Hispanic origins and 4 percent identified as Black (US Census update, 2011). The population served by SBIRT is primarily composed of patients at rural and urban health centers and a public dental clinic. Persons served in the public clinics are of lower socioeconomic status and represent a greater percentage of racial and linguistic minorities than the general population. Colorado SBIRT has also prioritized screening for pregnant women and women of child bearing age as part of a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder prevention effort.</p>
