<h3 class="accordion-header"> Population Served</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p>The Indiana SBIRT program focuses on patients involved in Indiana's extensive network of CHCs and CMHCs. SBIRT recipients in Wishard CHCs are typically urban, low-income, uninsured, and from diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. Fifty-eight percent of patients are African American, 38 percent are Caucasian, 23 percent are Hispanic, and 4 percent are of Asian, mixed, or unknown race.</p>
<p>Alcohol is the most commonly consumed substance in Indiana, with incidences of past-month binge drinking reported by at least 30 percent of adults. Marijuana is the most common illicit substance, particularly among high school students. Patient use of opiates and benzodiazepines is believed to be underreported. It was noted that rates of depression are also particularly high.</p>
