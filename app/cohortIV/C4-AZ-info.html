    <h3 class="accordion-header">Population Served</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <ul><li>The Arizona-SBIRT program serves individuals in Arizona’s five northernmost counties—Apache, Coconino, Mohave, Navajo, and Yavapai. </li>
<li>The 5 counties are primarily composed of White, Hispanic, and Native American individuals, and they include 10 tribal nations and a large population of individuals who speak languages other than English at home. </li>
<li>Median incomes in the counties are lower than the State median, and four of the five counties have higher poverty rates than the State average. </li>
<li>The five counties have high substance abuse-related morbidity and mortality rates and fewer resources to address these issues compared to other areas of the State. </li>
<li>The region served by the grant is considered a medically underserved area. Access to health services in northern Arizona is significantly affected by the geographic distances residents must travel to reach resources and the lack of available transportation. Poor weather conditions in the winter further inhibit travel.</li>
