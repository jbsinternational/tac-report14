    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Organization and Leadership</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Colorado SBIRT staff members are highly experienced grant administrators who have clearly defined relationships among the partnering organizations: the Department of Behavioral Health, Peer Assistance Services, and the Omni Institute.</li>
<li>Senior State leadership is highly committed to adopting SBIRT within primary care and other systems.</li>
<li>Colorado SBIRT builds and expands upon the foundation created as a previous SAMHSA SBIRT grantee.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Medicaid reimbursement codes and protocols for SBIRT are operational in Colorado at this time. However, billing providers for the services are limited, and there appear to be issues between providers and Medicaid regarding coding and billing, as well as significant differences between expected levels of compensation and actual compensation received.</li>
</ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">SBIRT Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The implementation model addresses organizational structure, workflow process, context, and culture.</li>
<li>Colorado SBIRT recruits and nurtures practice champions at each implementation site who support and guide implementation into the site.</li>
<li>The SBIRT program builds upon a foundation of prior implementation in primary care settings, collaboration among the participating organization, and in-depth content knowledge among the Colorado SBIRT partners.</li>
<li>Colorado SBIRT uses a sophisticated data system to support and monitor operations.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Colorado SBIRT experienced significant delays in program startup due to contracting delays with Peer Assistance and Omni Institute. As a result, some clinic sites had only been operational for 6 weeks at the time of this visit. Colorado has contracted with CSAT to deliver SBIRT services to 15,000 patients in the first year of the grant and anticipates falling short of this number by at least 12,000 in this first year. The Colorado SBIRT team has discussed this issue with its CSAT Project Officer and has developed a strategy to make up the contractually agreed-upon 12,000 plus screened patients.</li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Practice Site Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Each practice site adapts SBIRT implementation to the clinic's unique workflow and culture.</li>
<li>Each practice site has an identified SBIRT champion who supports the onsite health educator (HE) and program implementation.</li>
<li>The grantee established as a contractual obligation that all implementation sites will integrate SBIRT into their electronic health records.</li>
<li>The grantee has integrated SBIRT into a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder prevention initiative.</li>
<li>The grantee is implementing SBIRT into a dental practice.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The practice site in Colorado Springs has a relatively stable patient population and it is anticipated that all patients will have been screened by mid-contract. This creates potential challenges for the grantee achieving its target number of patients served.</li>
<li>Timely access to community-based substance abuse treatment is often described as challenging.</li>
<li>One practice site in Colorado Springs has behavioral health services onsite funded through the county behavioral health organization. However, contractual issues must be resolved before Colorado SBIRT patients with substance abuse disorders can access these services.</li>
<li>Colorado SBIRT does not have a defined brief treatment model; however, it has entered into discussions and are reviewing the model developed by Massachusetts SBIRT.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Cultural Competence</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The practice sites employ a diverse workforce that reflects the populations served within the health clinics.</li>
<li>The grantee provides cultural competence training as part of SBIRT training.</li>
</ul>


</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Training/Workforce Development</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Colorado SBIRT has significant training capacity to support SBIRT implementation.</li>
<li>The grantee has developed a comprehensive SBIRT training.</li>
<li>The grantee has a highly informative Web site.</li>
<li>The grantee has systems in place to monitor fidelity of implementation within the practice site and to provide ongoing coaching to health educators, supporting and strengthening their practice skills.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The health educator workforce is not credentialed, creating potential future challenges with health insurance reimbursement.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee has the support and commitment from senior State agency leadership through its PSC.</li>
<li>Medicaid codes are activated in Colorado.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee currently uses a health educator staffing model for its SBIRT implementation, posing possible challenges within insurance billing and reimbursement because these workers are usually unlicensed, must operate as a "physician extender," and have limited capacity to bill for other services.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Policy Steering Committee</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Colorado PSC, known as the Strategic Implementation Team, includes senior leadership from State government, representatives from the medical community, behavioral health, senior project leadership, and the recovery community.</li>
<li>The Strategic Implementation Team provides input to project leadership, addresses policy issues, and supports sustainability and implementation statewide.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, representatives from payers such as Medicaid and the State primary care provider association, Colorado Community Health Network (CCHN), are not included on the Strategic Implementation Team.</li>
</ul>
</div>
