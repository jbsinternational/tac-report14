                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The grantee has successfully implemented screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) services in four federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and within the Iowa National Guard. </li>
                <li>The grantee’s implementation team worked with each site, using a NIATx “walk-through” strategy, to tailor implementation to fit the organization’s workflow and culture. </li>
                <li>The grantee has employed a public health planning model, using population data to target SBIRT services.</li>
                <li>The grantee has developed a policies and procedures manual for the delivery and operation of SBIRT services.</li>
                <li>The grantee has implemented systems of regular communication with providers.</li>
                <li>Sites have co-located or integrated behavioral health care staff members who provide full screening, brief intervention, brief treatment, and referral to specialty care.</li>
                <li>The collaboration between the Iowa National Guard and the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) Bureau of Substance Abuse for delivering SBIRT and providing access to appropriate and timely care for soldiers and their families is notable and may serve as a model.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no interface between the electronic health records (EHRs) and the Web-based reporting system. Staff must make dual entries.</li>
                <li>According to State law, all documents translated by a State office must be approved by the Office of the Attorney General. This review process takes additional time.</li>
                
            </ul>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <ul>
                <li>SBIRT Iowa is managed by a highly experienced team of State personnel and key partners. The initiative builds on more than a decade of collaborative efforts between State and community partners.</li>
                <li>Implementation of SBIRT is part of the strategic vision for the State. The initiative has senior administrative buy-in and support within IDPH.</li>
                <li>The State has significantly invested in infrastructure that supports grant implementation, including several features: Web-based data reporting systems; training and workforce development capacity; performance-based contracting with providers; and the use of population data and evaluation findings to support planning, implementation, and management decisions.</li>
                <li>The grantee has been successful in its engagement with the Iowa National Guard Command.</li>
                <li>The grantee has successful working relationships with the Iowa Primary Care Association, which represents community health centers, and the Iowa Behavioral Health Association, which represents substance use and mental health services providers.</li>
                
                
                
                
                
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>None noted</li>
                
                
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each practice site has developed a workflow tailored to the site’s operations.</li>
                <li>Despite initial hesitation, physicians and allied primary care staff are highly supportive of the SBIRT process and the enhanced behavioral health and primary care collaboration.</li>
                <li>Sites are successfully serving diverse patient populations.</li>
                <li>Each site uses technology and a team approach to support the delivery of SBIRT services. </li>
                <li>SBIRT patient encounters are being integrated into EHRs.</li>
                <li>The grantee has adopted a defined evidence-based practice for brief treatment.</li>
                <li>Sites have adopted evidence-based strategies for patient engagement and retention. As a result, most brief treatment patients are being seen for six to eight sessions, nearly twice the duration reported at other locations.</li>
                <li>The grantee will translate certain program documents into other languages.</li>
                <li>The grantee provided orientation and training to all levels of staff members at the sites.</li>
                <li>All practice sites employ “warm handoffs” for patients referred to brief treatment or specialty care. This practice has greatly enhanced followthrough of patients into services.</li>
                <li>The Iowa National Guard Command, including the Adjutant General’s Office, in cooperation with IDPH, has successfully implemented SBIRT within the constructs of complex Army policies and procedures.</li>
                <li>The Iowa National Guard SBIRT team delivers brief treatment to soldiers in remote locations through a secure defense Web portal.</li>
                <li>The Iowa National Guard practice site provides SBIRT services at the annual health assessment required of all soldiers and accepts command referrals of soldiers who voluntarily seek services or are required to seek screening because of an incident or command concern.</li>
                <li>The Iowa National Guard SBIRT team, with the support of the Bureau of Substance Abuse, has prioritized referrals for specialty care when indicated to facilitate rapid access to services, often within 24 hours.</li>
                <li>All EHRs have uploaded screening tools, prepopulated templates, and American Society of Addiction Medicine patient placement criteria to support appropriate documentation and to inform referrals.</li>
                <li>All sites use an evidence-based brief intervention, the Brief Negotiated Interview.</li>
                <li>The use of brief treatment with National Guard soldiers appears to be highly successful.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenge</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Current Iowa Medicaid regulations limit access to same-day services. This policy poses significant obstacles for three sets of individuals or entities: for sites in providing integrated care; for patients with multiple health conditions who face access and transportation challenges; and for primary care systems in adopting a patient-centered medical home model.</li>

            <p>
                <b>Strength</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The grantee has successfully implemented a policy steering committee with diverse representation from key community stakeholders, including regulators, primary care and behavioral health provider associations, Medicaid, Iowa Blue Cross and Blue Shield, researchers, and others. </li>
                
                
            </ul>

                <b>Challenge</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>At this time, only one physician is on the policy steering committee.</li>

                <li>The grantee has met all of its contracted deliverables for its first year.</li>
                <li>The grantee used a data-driven planning process to determine service areas and contracted with service providers in those communities. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strength</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The grantee has initiated multiple strategies in preparation for the changes in the Iowa health care systems, including behavioral health/primary care integration, SBIRT integration with FQHCs, and use of EHRs. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenge</b>
            </p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>IDPH has identified SBIRT as part of an overarching strategy for integrated primary care and behavioral health services, including patient-centered medical homes.</li>
                <li>SBIRT services are currently reimbursable by Medicaid and other third-party payers.</li>
                <li>SBIRT services are embedded within EHRs at practice sites.</li>
                <li>The grantee has taken steps to groom SBIRT champions among stakeholders such as primary care providers, policymakers, and payers.</li>
                <li>The collaboration between SBIRT and the Iowa National Guard is highly consistent with the Guard’s emphasis on prevention and early intervention.</li>
                <li>Through the policy steering committee, SBIRT Iowa will conduct strategic planning to support sustainability. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Medicaid currently restricts delivery of SBIRT services. This restriction poses challenges to the development of a viable business model for SBIRT in primary care settings.</li>
                <li>Sites have not developed a business model that would support SBIRT beyond grant funding.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                <b>Strengths</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The State has contracted with an evaluation and research group that is experienced with large-scale followup activities with populations that are sometimes difficult to reach.</li>
                <li>The evaluation contractor has developed a practice manual that details evaluation activities.</li>
                <li>The grantee is using a Web-based data collection system for collecting and uploading required Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) information.</li>
                <li>Practice sites are using portable laptop computers for data collection.</li>
                <li>The evaluation includes both process and outcome measures to inform ongoing program planning and management.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The lack of interface between EHRs and the data collection system requires additional staff labor to complete dual data entries. </li>
                <li>There is no strategy to capture the impact of SBIRT for military personnel, beyond the required GPRA elements related to substance use and associated risk behaviors. Additional data could provide valuable information to support the long-term adoption of SBIRT in this and other military settings.</li>
