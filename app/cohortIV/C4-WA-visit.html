    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Organization and Leadership</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Strengths</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>WASBIRT-PCI staff members are highly experienced grant administrators who build effectively on extensive knowledge gained and infrastructure developed during the previous SBIRT cohort.</li>
            <li>Senior leadership is highly committed to adopting SBIRT within primary care and other systems and shows innovation utilizing available resources.</li>
            <li>WASBIRT-PCI team knows and understands roles and has well-defined responsibilities.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">SBIRT Implementation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Strengths</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Sea Mar Community Health Center clinics and Public Health&ndash;Seattle &amp; King County have successfully initiated SBIRT.</li>
            <li>Swedish Medical Center and Harborview, influential statewide entities, are engaged to become SBIRT implementation sites.</li>
            <li>The SBIRT program builds upon a foundation of prior successful grants and collaboration among the participating organizations as well as in-depth content knowledge among the WASBIRT-PCI partners.</li>
            <li>WASBIRT-PCI lost one targeted implementation site but has subsequently gained interest from eight additional clinics.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The grantee describes a need to further develop the brief treatment (BT) component for implementation sites.</li>
            <li>Some implementation sites are experiencing challenges with workflow and establishing site protocol.</li>
            <li>Statewide billing codes are not activated at this time, and behavioral health specialists, medical assistants, and other non-licensed professionals cannot bill for reimbursement of SBIRT services.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Practice Site Implementation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Strengths</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementation sites (Sea Mar and Public Health&ndash;Seattle &amp; King County) have self- motivated staff at all levels that strive to make improvements and systems changes.</li>
            <li>Sea Mar Community Health Center had a strong integrative care and team approach established prior to implementation, which aided a smooth transition to SBIRT integration.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementation sites mentioned concerns with medical assistant (MA) buy-in and need for additional staff training, particularly around motivational interviewing (MI).</li>
            <li>The grantee mentioned that they needed to change tactics during implementation concerning whom to work with at implementation sites. They found that working with the medical director, and then moving down the line of the organizational chart at a site, yielded better results than targeting behavioral health administrators and then having to go back to connect with higher leadership.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Cultural Competence</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Strengths</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The grantee shows high level of cultural competence and consideration of the diverse populations served by implementation sites. For example, Sea Mar, one of the implementation sites, has made a point of employing staff that are culturally matched to their patient population and has translated SBIRT resources into five different languages and is in the process of adding more.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>While staff members are culturally matched to their patient populations, there is a potential to assume a level of cultural competence that may not be present. For example, one implementation site noted cultural barriers screening older adults and pregnant women that resulted in lower screening levels for these populations.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Training/Workforce Development</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Strengths</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>WASBIRT-PCI adapted SBIRT training for future implementation clinics to include the entire medical team including medical assistant (MA), behavioral health intervention specialists (BHIs), and medical doctors (MDs) to aid with buy-in and to ensure that the entire team understands the SBIRT process.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>BHI staff at Public Health&ndash;Seattle & King County mentioned that they would benefit from additional training, particularly in MI.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Strengths</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>With sustainability in mind, WASBIRT-PCI leadership is pursuing integrating multiple data collection systems and using EPIC to collect AUDIT and DAST records into patient health records.</li>
            <li>The grantee plans to train licensed social workers (embedded in the Swedish Medical system) in SBIRT. This measure both makes use of non-grant dependent positions and allows for service reimbursement when billing codes are turned on.</li>
            <li>WASBIRT-PCI leadership is motivated to pursue innovative billing opportunities beyond turning State SBIRT codes on.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>BHIs are an integral component of the flow for current implementation sites, posing possible challenges for funding these positions beyond the grant funding period.</li>
            <li>The grantee is interested in making a business case for covering SBIRT primary care services under a payer system after its success under the previous grant demonstrating cost effectiveness of SBIRT in emergency departments.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Policy Steering Committee</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Strengths</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>WASBIRT-PCI has a strong, organized, and diverse Policy Steering Committee (PSC).</li>
            <li>WASBIRT- PCI has clearly delineated the PSC roles and responsibilities.</li>
            <li>PSC subcommittees are effectively utilized to accomplish tasks.</li>
            <li>PSC includes over 30 members representing diverse perspectives including WASBIRT- PCI staff, each participating clinic site, payer organizations, public entities, Washington State Health Care authorities, and non-profits.</li>
            <li>PSC is composed of subcommittees that meet regularly in small groups to complete specific tasks and then report back to the full PSC.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>PSC subcommittees do not have representatives from some key stakeholders (for example, primary care physicians, individuals in recovery, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Strengths</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The grantee has a clearly defined plan for evaluation including GPRA collection, GPRA follow-up, and process evaluation.</li>
            <li>The grantee is self-motivated to expand on the innovative evaluation plan from the previous SBIRT grant.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The grantee described a need to relate results of the evaluation to staff in a manner that provides incentive and motivation.</li>
            <li>The grantee has interest in implementing a process evaluation that will allow them to track implementation more closely.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
