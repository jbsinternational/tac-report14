<h3>What is an implementation site visit, and why is it done?</h3>
<p>Past experience has shown that challenges with implementation and meeting the expectations of the Request for Application most often occur in the first year of implementation. To prevent missteps in Cohort IV grantee implementation and to support success, site visits were completed within 7 to 10 months of the first year of operation, during the grantees’ implementation phase.</p>
<p>The site visit process surveys grantee activities along certain essential areas of implementation:
    <ul>
        <li>Realistic performance goals and objectives</li>
        <li>A defined implementation plan with action steps to achieve the plan</li>
        <li>Clearly defined project management agreements and roles, including partners</li>
        <li>Leadership buy-in supporting program readiness and startup, including practice site champions</li>
        <li>Defined systems for regular communication among partners, as well as easy access for ad hoc communication</li>
        <li>Protocols for program operations, including use of technology, common sets of tools, and processes</li>
        <li>Participatory decisionmaking among implementation team members</li>
        <li>Ongoing training, technical assistance, monitoring, and coaching to support implementation, fidelity to the model, and sustainability</li>
        <li>Use of evaluation to support and monitor implementation</li>
        <li>Sensitivity to unique contextual conditions at the practice sites, the populations being served, and any associated need for adaptation</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>What happens during an implementation site visit?</h3>
<p>The site visit teams consist of previously successful SBIRT implementers (peer mentors) and staff from the Technical Assistance contract (JBS International, Inc., and Alliances for Quality Education, Inc.). Team tasks include:
    <ul>
        <li>Engaging grantees and key stakeholders in meaningful discussions</li>
        <li>Observing and reporting on grantee implementation progress</li>
        <li>Identifying grantee strengths and challenges</li>
        <li>Identifying any potential enhancements that might be supported by technical assistance, as approved by SAMHSA</li>
        <li>Providing technical assistance, when appropriate</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>The site visit process includes multiple components:
    <ul>
        <li>Advance preparation by the team reviewing grant applications, periodic reports, and discussions with the project officer</li>
        <li>Meeting onsite with the principal investigator/project director, core senior faculty, key partners, the project evaluator, the project coordinator, and State agency senior leadership</li>
        <li>Reviewing materials</li>
        <li>Visiting SBIRT implementation sites and interviewing staff</li>
        <li>Meeting with key implementation partners</li>
        <li>Meeting with the Policy Steering Committee</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>What have been the outcomes of conducting site visits during the implementation phase?</h3>
<p>Overall, the grantees have responded extremely positively to these early site visits. Positive outcomes include:
    <ul>
        <li>Forging constructive relationships between grantees and grantee mentors (also called peer consultants)</li>
        <li>Expanding project officers’ knowledge of grantee operations</li>
        <li>Identifying and sharing lessons learned and unique and notable grantee accomplishments</li>
        <li>Providing immediate onsite feedback and assistance to grantees</li>
        <li>Increasing grantee comfort and knowledge about the technical assistance process</li>
        <li>Obtaining specific requests for technical assistance from several grantees—on topics such as integrating SBIRT into faith-based communities and improving the functionality of the Policy Steering Committee</li>
    </ul>
