<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Organization and Leadership</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>DMHAS staff members are highly experienced grant administrators who have clearly defined relationships with their partnering organizations: the University of Connecticut and the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut.</li>
<li>Senior State leadership is highly committed to adopting SBIRT within primary care and other systems and has made SBIRT adoption a written priority since 2005.</li>
<li>DMHAS collaborates with the State Medicaid Office for managing Medicaid behavioral health services.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee describes a need to further engage and mobilize support from within primary care systems.</li>
<li>Medicaid reimbursement for SBIRT is partially operational in Connecticut at this time, and the reimbursement rates have been described as significantly below the actual service delivery costs.</li>
</ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">SBIRT Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>DMHAS uses a defined model for program implementation based on health service program implementation and sustainability research of Greenhalgh, et al.</li>
<li>The DMHAS implementation model addresses organizational structure, process, context, and culture. Further, it addresses interorganizational relationships, dissemination of program-specific content knowledge, leadership, and planning.</li>
<li>The SBIRT program builds upon a foundation of prior successful partnership and collaboration among the participating organizations and in-depth content knowledge among the DMHAS partners.</li>
<li>DMHAS has well developed processes for communication among program partners and for carefully monitoring program implementation.</li>
</ul>


</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Practice Site Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Each practice site adapts SBIRT implementation to the clinic's unique workflow and culture.</li>
<li>Each practice site has an identified SBIRT champion who supports the onsite health educator (HE) and program implementation.</li>
<li>The grantee, through its University of Connecticut partner, has developed LET'S PLAY&mdash; evidence-based motivational interviewing/cognitive behavioral therapy brief treatment specifically adapted for SBIRT and primary care.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Universal screening is not fully operational at this time as the HE is completing prescreening, full screening, and brief interventions.</li>
<li>Practice site primary care clinicians and allied health staff have received only an initial SBIRT orientation and have not been fully trained in the model. Training for these staff is to begin in fall 2012.</li>
<li>All health clinics are either using or preparing for electronic health records (EHRs). As well, multiple EHRs are used among the 10 sites, creating compatibility challenges.</li>
<li>Currently, the HE cannot document within the patient health record.</li>
<li>The "start-up" HE model only provides SBIRT to a limited number of patients at each site.</li>
</ul>
</div>
