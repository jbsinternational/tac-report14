    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Organization and Leadership</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The implementation team includes a diverse complement of primary health care and behavioral health care staff.</li>
<li>Evaluation staff is embedded into clinical practice and leadership, allowing for immediate data access and evaluation to support implementation and quality control.</li>
<li>A well-defined system of formal and informal communication is supporting implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Meharry Hospital site has institutional review board (IRB) issues delaying startup, as its review board has characterized this initiative as research rather than service implementation.</li>
<li>Other implementation issues at Meharry include a lack of administrative champions and faculty buy-in. These issues could potentially result in Meharry experiencing further delays with implementation.</li>
</ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">SBIRT Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee has developed a detailed logic model that outlines the SBIRT implementation process.</li>
<li>Staff and the Policy Steering Committee (PSC) are willing to be flexible, based on lessons learned from implementation. This flexibility supports adapting implementation to the unique needs of individual sites.</li>
<li>The grantee is working with Mercer University to support resident training.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SBIRT clinic training is not well established or outlined.</li>
<li>There is no replicable or ongoing training in place for site staff.</li>
<li>Fidelity strategies are needed.</li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Practice Site Implementation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee plans to start up the second ETSU site in Johnson City by September 1, 2012.</li>
<li>Implementation is adapted to the unique context of each site.</li>
<li>The grantee is implementing SBIRT as part of the ANG members' annual heath readiness assessment.</li>
<li>The grantee has set aside additional State funds to further support its SBIRT/National Guard project.</li>
<li>SBIRT billing codes have been activated in Tennessee.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Meharry Clinic is still in the IRB process and has not yet implemented at that site.</li>
<li>Practice sites are unfamiliar with coding and billing SBIRT. They will require training and technical assistance.</li>
<li>The contractor who will be implementing SBIRT within the ANG will require implementation training so that clinical staff will understand that SBIRT is a public health approach to substance use that is different from substance abuse services.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Cultural Competence</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee is knowledgeable about the rural population needs at the Johnson City and Bristol locations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Residence staff members from ETSU who have been involved in a rural "Health Literacy" initiative reported that 25 percent of adults served in the rural health centers are not functionally literate.</li>
<li>The grantee will be providing services to the Tennessee ANG, using clinicians who may not fully understand military culture.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Training/Workforce Development</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee has partnered with ETSU to train medical residents.</li>
<li>The grantee is working with SECAT/Mercer University to assist with curriculum development for the residency programs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee does not have a statewide infrastructure to support training and technical assistance.</li>
<li>The grantee does not have fully developed SBIRT curricula to be delivered to allied health staff and behavioral health clinicians.</li>
<li>TN SBIRT does not currently have systems in place to support intervention fidelity.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee has primary care physician representation in the PSC.</li>
<li>The State has activated SBIRT billing codes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although insurance codes have been activated, providers have barely utilized them to date because they require training and technical assistance in SBIRT delivery as well as in coding, documentation, and billing for the service.</li>
<li>To date, the PSC has focused primarily on implementation.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Policy Steering Committee</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PSC members are actively involved in supporting implementation. PSC members are well respected by the wider medical community and thus have access to conferences and other dissemination activities.</li>
<li>PSC members understand the business aspects of programs, including billing and coding.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are no payers (Medicaid/Medicare or private insurance) involved.</li>
<li>Understandably, at this time the grantee and its activities are focused on startup. In the coming months, the grantee will need to support the PSC members as they begin identifying and addressing long-term sustainability issues.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee had initial implementation challenges with screening and effectively used evaluation data to identify the issue. The grantee sought and used technical assistance and used their evaluation capacity to monitor and document performance improvement.</li>
<li>The evaluation team is embedded in clinical practice, and evaluation is a part of the SBIRT process.</li>
<li>The evaluation team is capable of providing real-time data to monitor performance.</li>
</ul>
