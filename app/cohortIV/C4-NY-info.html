<div class="accordion-content"> 

<ul>
<li>Establish a State Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) to promote, monitor, assist, and assess the implementation of SBIRT services in the State's primary care, community health, and specialist settings to decrease the impact of SUDs on the health of all New Yorkers.</li>
<li>Demonstrate a successful SBIRT program in two large, high-need, culturally and ethnically diverse but systemically different systems: NYC public STD clinics, and multiple hospitals/clinics targeting the veteran population in Jefferson County, NY (Fort Drum).</li>
<li>Disseminate the Fort Drum and STD clinic models to additional providers serving the military community and county public health systems across the State during the second half of NYSBIRT.</li>

<h3 class="accordion-header"> Population Served</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p>With 19.5 million residents, New York ranks third in population behind California and Texas. More than 42 percent of the State's population resides in New York City, and an additional 23 percent reside in the six counties closest to New York City. New York's diverse population is 73.4 percent White, 17.3 percent Black, and 7 percent Asian; 16.7 percent are of Hispanic origin. New York has a 0.6 percent Native American population that includes seven sovereign Indian nations.</p>
<p>NYSBIRT has targeted two primary populations for service within this initiative: adults served within Harlem STD clinics in New York City, and Army personnel at Fort Drum in Watertown, New York. Both target populations are recognized as experiencing higher levels of substance use risk.</p>
