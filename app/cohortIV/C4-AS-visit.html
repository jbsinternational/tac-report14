            <ul>
                <li>American Samoa has a flat government structure, centralizing management of SBIRT.</li>
                <li>Senior leadership in American Samoa is highly committed to the successful implementation and sustainability of the program.</li>
                <li>O le Alofa SBIRT staff members are very dedicated to improving the lives of persons in their community. The project director and clinical director are both highly experienced grant administrators and clinicians.</li>

                <li>High level of buy-in has been achieved from partner organizations, especially medical partners.</li>
                <li>There is a low-cost health care system based on facility fees rather than fee for service.</li>

            <p>
                <b>Challenges</b>

                <li>SBIRT implementation in medical care settings is not reaching all persons in need.</li>
                <li>Health care is primarily funded through Federal dollars that vary in support annually.</li>

        </div>

                <li>Only the Wellness Questionnaire is translated to Samoan.</li>
