<h3 class="accordion-header"> Population Served</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p>The Illinois SBIRT program provides service to adult residents in northwest Illinois (Cook County). It is estimated that 1,025,000 individuals over the age of 12 in this jurisdiction are in need of treatment for alcohol or drug use/abuse. A report released by the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) and the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program stated that heroin prevalence is particularly high in the Chicago Metropolitan area. Moreover, the Cook County Jail has the country's highest percentage of detainees who tested positive for heroin. The average patient receiving SBIRT services, to date, is female (63.3 percent) and approximately37.9 years of age. Fifty-six percent of patients identify their race as African American and 30.9 percent identify their ethnicity as Hispanic.</p>
