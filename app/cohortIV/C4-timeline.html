                            <p>The Arizona SBIRT program (AZ-SBIRT) aims to reduce substance-related mortality and the prevalence of substance use disorders in northern Arizona by expanding and enhancing the State’s system of behavioral health care to include SBIRT services. At the time of the site visit, five provider sites—including emergency departments and community health clinics—had begun implementing SBIRT at their facilities, with SBIRT services administered by existing staff. Grant funds had not been used to place personnel exclusively dedicated to implementing SBIRT at each site, and providers were administering only screenings and brief interventions and referring clients as needed to an outside entity to receive treatment. Several new provider sites were identified to implement SBIRT with their client populations in upcoming months, and services were scheduled to begin at Yavapai Regional Medical Center and Canyonlands Healthcare in July 2013 and at Kingman Regional Medical Center in January 2014. Medical providers and emergency department staff at all sites were to be trained on SBIRT protocols, and institutional policies were to be developed to prescreen all patients and adhere to the SBIRT process.</p>

Austin Health Center, and work creatively to engage other participating agencies. Because of these startup delays, New Jersey was placed on “high risk” and required to provide SAMHSA with a corrective action plan. At the time of the site visit, New Jersey had not yet completed and submitted the plan.</p>
